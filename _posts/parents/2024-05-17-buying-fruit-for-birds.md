excerpt: "My children are birds. I am a squirrel."

I donâ€™t mind buying fruit for my littles. Itâ€™s a perfectly healthy snack, helps their little bodies absorb iron, and looks great on the table. But, my children are baby birds.

I spend half of my life getting them fruit that they take 2 bites of and leave to rot ðŸ¤ª. I spend the other half of my life picking up and eating the rest of the abandoned fruit.

My life has gone from being a hospitality professional to a scavenging squirrel. Best promotion ever!



Let's talk potatoes. Three years ago I found myself with some forgotten potatoes in the pantry, eyes were just starting to form so i thought why not plant them and see what happens. As spring came around my daughter loved the potato hunt!  This has started our yearly potato planting in the summer and harvesting as the plants die. Each year we find new tricks and have a whole new experience. 

Potatoes have taught me sometimes its not about the harvest, but its about the joy it brings while dirt goes flying and the harvest is found.
