excerpt: "My children are birds. I am a squirrel."

I donâ€™t mind buying fruit for my littles. Itâ€™s a perfectly healthy snack, helps their little bodies absorb iron, and looks great on the table. But, my children are baby birds.

I spend half of my life getting them fruit that they take 2 bites of and leave to rot ðŸ¤ª. I spend the other half of my life picking up and eating the rest of the abandoned fruit.

My life has gone from being a hospitality professional to a scavenging squirrel. Best promotion ever!



Potatoes are little pirate chests - easily forgettable/lost and fun to hunt. 

Three years ago I found myself with some forgotten potatoes in the pantry. The *eyes* were just starting to form so I thought, "why not plant them and see what happens."

As spring came around, my daughter loved the potato hunt! Now, every year we plant potatoes in the summer and harvest them as the plants wither. Each year, the kids forget we planted them and have a blast digging them up.

It's not about the harvest but the joy it brings while dirt goes flying and the harvest is found.
