excerpt: "My children are birds. I am a squirrel."
---

I donâ€™t mind buying fruit for my littles. Itâ€™s a perfectly healthy snack, helps their little bodies absorb iron, and looks great on the table. But, my children are baby birds.

I spend half of my life getting them fruit that they take 2 bites of and leave to rot ðŸ¤ª. I spend the other half of my life picking up and eating the rest of the abandoned fruit.

My life has gone from being a hospitality professional to a scavenging squirrel. Best promotion ever!
