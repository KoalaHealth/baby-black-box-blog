As my youngest is rounding the corner to age 1, I have been going through my old photos reflecting on this beautiful year. I stumbled on these shots of my oldest helping me proof some of our gifts and swag. I love that she already has an interest in creating and building and hope she continues to spread her love of positive crafting to others!

Happy Fall! And, see you in the next post!
