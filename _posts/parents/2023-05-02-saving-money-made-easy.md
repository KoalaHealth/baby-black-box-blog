Disclaimer- I am a conservative person when it comes to sharing my financial information with people but my husband does a ton of research on companies and reminded me that banks and credit card companies sell your spending history to make a profit. Last year, I saved over a hundred dollars on my normal shopping by using these three Apps. 


**Ibotta** - cash back by scanning your receipt. I normally look through the app to see what they have cash back on and if they have any free/heavily discounted items. The thing I love about this app is once you go shopping you scan your receipt and your savings will be added to your account.  My little loves fruits and Daves jail bread ibotta often has $.20 or more back on any strawberry or blueberry purchese with $1.50 to $2 off jail bread. I can often stack both those offers on top of their $.10 back on any receipt scanned coupon. last summer Ibotta had free oat milk which I do not give my little to drink but I do use it to cook with when I make her homemade oat bars. Once you reach $20 in savings you can trade it out for gift cards or transfer it to your bank account. If you use my link below to sign up and scan your first savings you will get a referral bonus loaded to your account. 


**Think bigger**: Jan 2022 ibotta had 2% off Safeway receipts and Chase bank had 5% back on grocery stores so you could stack and receive 7% back on your Safeway purchase (some exclusions of course).

**Rakuten** - is a *shop through* site. Before I make any online purchase I go to my Rakuten app and see if that site has any cash back. They usually have Target, Walmart, Carters, oshkosh bigosh oldnavy and macy's the percent backs range from 1%-15% back. What I normally do is load what I need to my cart using the company app or website. Before checking out go to Rakuten find the company I need then log into my account and complete the transaction. everything i had in my cart will be there with any company coupons or deals already loaded. This is how I double and triple save on online orders. 

Use my link and receive a referral bonus when you complete your first shop through experience.

**Honey** -  is similar to rakuten in the form that you shop through their platform, but it also helps you look for coupons and deals that can be added to your cart. What is nice about honey is you can add an extension to your browser so discounts will pop up as you shop. 


Happy shopping everyone!
