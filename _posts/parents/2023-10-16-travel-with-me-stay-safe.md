excerpt: "Prevention is better than intervention. Check your hotel room or rental before your children find the trouble!"

Working in the hotel hospitality industry has forever changed the way I travel. I am more aware and careful about the cleanliness and the safety level of the room, especially with kids.

We as parents know kids find everything and cleaners are human. No matter how detail-oriented the housekeeping staff, they miss things from time to time, and I would rather find the issues and address them before my kids.

So, these are the things I do first as I walk into a hotel room or check into a rental: 

1. I look for nicknacks (including vases, pitchers, easily accessible junk snacks) and move them! 
2. I lay down or move any tall end tables - they can fall easily and are much heavier than you think. 
3. I lie on the floor, looking around for anything dangerous or nasty that could have been left behind. You would be surprised what you can find under the bed!
4. Don't forget to check under sofas and chairs, too. 
5. I open all low cabinets, to make sure nothing was left. Especially in rental homes, I look for sharps and pest poisons.
6. I close all doors that do not need to be open, including bathrooms (close toilet lids), bedrooms, and closets. 

The things I bring with me:

- Pack-n-play
- Extra hair bands - used to lock and close doors/cabinets, so we don't have to use semi-permanent adhesives.

Happy travels! If these tips help, send me a message! If you have any tips of your own, share them here, too  <3
