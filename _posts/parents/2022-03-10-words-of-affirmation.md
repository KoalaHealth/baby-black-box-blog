excerpt: "It's important to feel appreciated. Try a love language quiz with your significant other."

As a Type A career-driven woman, I only really thought about words of affirmation in my marriage after having a kid.

It is definitely a necessity. My little bundle of joy is a horrible sleeper. She is up every 30 mins to an hour. I am breastfeeding and pumping still. We know we want another child so I have been really focused on eating healthily and going for walks/runs with the baby to try to get my body back. 

With everything new on my plate, I have found that I really need to hear words of affirmation from my husband. The moments when he says "thank you" and "you are doing a great job" really melts my heart and brings the "warm and cuddly" feelings.

As a parent, you and your world changes. My husband and I wanted to know the types of appreciation that truly make us happy. I definitely recommend doing a love language quiz with your significant other a few months after you welcome your little one into the world.
