Parenting is hard.  Sharing personal insights is scary.  Baby Black Box is a place where real parents share and record their experiences as they happen "mid-flight" in the journey of parenthood!


title: Where to register to get samples and discounts. 

Target- 
Create an online baby registry and make it public. Then go into any target, go to customer service and ask( they are often out) you can also try to get it online through the registry when you make an order over $30 you just pay $.05. With both kids they didnâ€™t scan my phone in store, so I was able to get one in store and one online. 
You also will get a coupon for 15% off. It can be used once in store and once online for items on your registry. Because I have winter babies I put loads of holiday gifts,  clothes for all of us and some food. The discount worked for almost everything. ** even if you do not have a target near you I would still register as you can use the 15% discount once online and it is stacked on other items. 

Amazon- create a registry then once someone (could be you) purchase $30 or more you can go in and ship the welcome box to yourself for free. Michael and I both have Amazon accounts and we both could do this. 
Benefits: You received a 15% discount that can be used twice on select leftover baby registry items. The discount becomes available before your due date, so you can stock up on baby items before your bundle arrives. You can also use the second discount after your little one has arrived. There are many more benefits not listed but you do need to read the fine print.  

Walmart- create a registry then you have to go to a special Walmart baby box site and enter your information including the url from your registry. Then it will be shipped to you. This box was one of the best baby registry sample box/ packs I received.
 Benefits: No purchase required to qualify for the free samples;  create multiple registries and send them to friends and neighbors addresses to really optimize on the samples. 

Buy buy baby-  You just create a registry then walk in and  they will give you the bag. They also do a 15% off coupon for one item and the coupon can be used online.


Formula companies: I plan to breastfeed but based on the research I have found some women struggle to breastfeed especially in the first few days. I signed up for both similac and enfamil just so make sure we have coupons and a small amount of formula in case we need it. 
Similac- if you sign up for Similac's reward program they will send you coupons that can be used at your local store. 

Enfamil- I highly recommend signing up for the Enfamil reward program. Once you sign up, they will send you two small cans of formula and coupons that can be used at your local store.
