Road trips with littles is a living nightmare for many parents/guardians, but it doesn't have to be (with most children)! Thorough pre-planning and knowing your child(ren) can help manage the ups and downs of a long road trip or flight, starting with snack prep!

I am blessed that I can road trip to family every year. I have been taking my oldest on an 8 hour road trip since she was 5 months old. The first time I completely overpacked and almost backed out because of nerves. Now, I like to think I am a *well oiled machine*, at least when it comes to snack prep!

This is what I pack for my family's on-the-go snacks for 4 days!

#### On the road: 
- Apple sauce pouch (reusable pouches)
- Cheese sticks
- Salami
- Fig bars for a quick grab
- Cheerios

#### For the house or hotel:
- Homemade bagels & cream cheese (<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/homemade-bagels" alt="Baby Black Box Homemade Bagel recipe">recipe here</a>)
- Homemade oatmeal cookies (<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/lactation-oatmeal-cookies" alt="Baby Black Box lactation oatmeal cookie recipe">recipe here</a>)
- Large tumbler of milk 

#### Adult snacks: 
- Nuts 
- Coffee 
- Tea 


### Why I choose these snacks:

For the road, I like quick easy snacks that can be handed back easily to the back seat. I also like snacks that can be in a little cooler bag and will feel refreshing for both kids and adults. 

Bagels are great easy breakfasts, especially if pre-cut. 

**MILK MILK MILK** - my kids love milk so it is a must at least 2-3 times a day. I tried the single pack, organic boxes that don't have to be refrigerated, and my children hated them. So, I refrigerate a big thermos and fill it with milk. Make sure to refrigerate as you go!

Nuts are bad snacks while driving because of choking risks. But, they are excellent protein-packed snacks for breastfeeding mamas and at the park or zoo!

Remember, plan ahead and know your children. A little forethought can go a long way to easing a family trip. You can do it, too!
