excerpt: 'I found many online pregnacy "must-buy" lists were not actually helpful.  These are the things I actually used and found valuable.'
---

We lived in a small one-bedroom apartment when I was pregnant with my first and moved to a two-bedroom before getting pregnant with my second. So, space has been limited, and transitioning from working to being a stay-at-home mom, finances are something I have to be super considerate of. When I was pregnant, I found crazy long lists of things to buy, but I felt like it was all marketing or extra.

Here is a list I put together of the things I personally used or needed through my pregnancies. 

**While trying to conceive:**
- A good prenatal and calcium supplement 
- Start a working out routine that can flex while pregnant 

**1st Trimester**
- Running maternity shorts*
- Maternity leggings  
- Butt pillow** 
- *To eat:*
    - Ginger chews - hello morning sickness 
    - Crackers/ granola bars
 
*I did not buy these for my first pregnancy and it was a horrible regret. I lived in them for my second pregnancy. They are comfortable and help curve around your new bump. 

** I suffered from sciatica through both of my pregnancies and had a very tender vagina postpartum. This pillow was a lifesaver and is something I still use when sitting on the floor playing with the kids 

**2nd and 3rd Trimesters**
- Stretch mark cream 
- Good water bottle with a straw and handle 
- Pregnancy pillow - long one***
- *To eat:*
    - 6 dates a day - not if you have blood sugar issues 
    - Prunes - if you are feeling backed up. 

*** The pregnancy pillow my husband got me was so amazing!!! Having a long one that can twist and turn came in handy when I was dealing with those first few months being up every two hours breastfeeding. I could use it to support myself and the baby. Definitely a worth wild purchase especially if you want more than one kid. 

**3rd+ trimester**
- Comfortable loose shirts/dresses 
- Comfortable bras (nursing bras work great)
- Stuff for your hospital bag, if you need any. 
- Start perineal massage 

Come back and let me know if you find this list helpful or have questions!
