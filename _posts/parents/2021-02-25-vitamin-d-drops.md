I had no idea breast fed babies need vitamin D drops. I did not find out until I was filling out the questionnaire for my child’s one month doctors appointment.  Breast fed babies receive almost all of the nutrition that they need through the mother's breast milk but they do not receive vitamin D, so it is important that you give them a drop a day. 

It seems like such a simple, small thing but in the moment, it seemed like another huge thing to remember. Between being sleep deprived, trying to figure out the breastfeeding thing, pumping to get enough milk for my child, trying to create a freezer stash, taking my vitamins, feeding the family, and making sure the drops are given. I found the easiest way to remember was to store all the vitamin’s together and keep them where you sit or on your table where you eat (if you have other children, don't forget to keep them up high).
