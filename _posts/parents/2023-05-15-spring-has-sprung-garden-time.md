excerpt: "Try a little gardening!  It's a great opportunity to learn with your kids."

Being a stay-at-home mom is stressful. It is the job you never get a true break from. In an attempt to lower my stress levels, find something new to do with my 6 month old, and get my family eating healthier, I started a garden. 

A small garden in my small apartment. As a self-labeled numb thumb who has killed every plant I have ever owned, this was a far-fetched idea but my husband was willing to go along with it. 

The first year, about half the plants died, but I learned what plants did not grow well on our patio. Last year, I scaled back a ton and learned you can grow a whole new basil plant from a cutting (*hello <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/10-minute-pesto">pesto</a>*).

This year, we are focusing on less variety but more plants we know we can grow. 

**The best thing about having a garden is using it as an outdoor teaching tool. I use it to teach our daughter about:**
- Patience (we start most from seed) 
- Planting
- Watering (chores)
- Colors 
- Stages of growth 
- Picking plants 
- Being careful and gentle 
- And what part of plants you can fully eat/use. 

**Plants I have and highly recommend:**
- Basil 
- Cherry Tomatoes 
- Jalape√±os (we love spice and you can harvest the seeds from one you buy in the store - let me know if you need help!)
- Edible flowers (new this year) 

Happy gardening everyone! I would love to hear your gardening stories, if this inspires you!
