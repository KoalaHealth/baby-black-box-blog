My husband and I have known each other for over 20 years now, so parenting and being there for each other seemed very natural. He knew how to support me when I didn’t even know I needed or wanted support in that way. I wrote down some of the things he did as tips and tricks for supporting a pregnant mama. 

Becoming a parent changes the dynamic of your relationship, and the postpartum journey can make a big difference in your significant other's mental health. Being a unit working together and ensuring she feels supported as she heals is extremely important. 


### During pregnancy: 

- Be patient.
- If she sounds crazy, you don’t need to point it out hormones are a beast.
- If she snaps at you, let it go (within reason). 
- Make sure she is drinking plenty of water.
- Cook simple meals or warm up left overs.
- Clean all smelly items, toilet, trash, compost, animal poop, etc.
- Do the dishes.
- Pack your own hospital bag or at least put out what you want to take. 
- Know the birth plan.
- Ask if she wants photos of the birth or after birth. 
- Know the communication/social media birth plan.
- Do not push for visitors until she is ready. (You did not just have a baby come out of you. It is about her!). 


### During labor: 
- Make sure you are ready to deliver on the birth plan.
- Help advocate for her and her wishes.
- Give words of encouragement.
- Have water and ice ALWAYS ready and offer it to her. ( I drank water between each push).


### Post delivery: in hospital 
- Make sure she has water and food/snacks.
- Diapers- they are all yours!!!
- Learn to burp the baby.
- Learn to feed the baby (if you are giving bottles).
- Ask her if she wants to shower (help, if needed).


### Post delivery: at home 
- Make sure she has water!!!
- Diapers… still yours.. not all but do as many as you can. 
- If it’s a rough night offer to burp the baby so she can go back to sleep after feeding. 
- If she is pumping. Know how to put away& log the breast milk so you can help. 
- Take out the bathroom trash. 
- Do the dishes, including but not limited to pump parts and bottles. 
- Cook meals or reheat meals. 
- Offer to hold the baby so your partner can eat in peace. 
- LET HER SHOWER, say the words “I have the baby why don’t you take some time to shower or rest”.
