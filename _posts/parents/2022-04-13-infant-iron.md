excerpt: "Make sure to check your infant's iron levels."

As a Mama who has had my own personal struggles with iron, I did loads of research to make sure I was aware of the ways my kid needed and would absorb iron. 

Iron is a common mineral required by the body for healthy growth and development.

I knew I wanted to be a mom who made most of my kids' food at home to avoid extra additives, but it's important to provide balanced meals with all the necessary vitamins and minerals. I found iron is one of the main beneficial additives that companies use because it is so important for children. 


**The foods I try first:**
- Leafy greens- Spinach 
- Broccoli 
- Red meat 
- Poultry 
- Oats


**Common allergens with good iron levels:**
- Nuts- checking hazard so nut butter is a great way to add this to your littles diet 
- Tofu- soy allergy 
- Eggs


I highly recommend an 18 month blood draw for common vitamin deficiencies and nutrition blood tests. A blood draw is always terrifying and horrible to go through as a parent but it will alert you if you need to put your little one on a supplement. Littles grow so fast both physically and mentally, so they are burning iron at a very high rate. If your little does test low in iron, it's ok. My husband and I had to put my oldest on a supplement even though I did all of these things. So, please make sure you get your little ones checked. 


Keep an eye out on the creative ways I add iron rich foods to our daily meals!
