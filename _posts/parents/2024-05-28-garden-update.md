This year my garden has taken a turn for the worse. My youngest's habit of "flood watering" and "pruning" the biggest leaves from a plant has caught up to our crop this year; he is a rough and tumble little guy.

I recognized my little's "heavy hand" for plants, so I steered clear of many delicate plants (except basil) and focused on hearty plants like sweet potatoes, potatoes, mint and tomatoes. 

Though the harvest is a bit different this year, I am excited to have a garden the kids can handle with "tough love."
