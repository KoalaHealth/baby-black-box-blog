Congratulations! on your bundle of joy!

As we started planning on extending our family I combed the internet. I read tons of mom blogs and watched hundreds of hours of vlogs. To me, it all boiled down to everyone's budget, space, ideas and values are different. You will want to spend money on some things and you will be open to accepting certain things second hand.

This was our journey: 

We joined the Facebook Buy Nothing group and Nextdoor for our local area. These sites gave us access to free/ cheap second hand items.

As my husband and I were both working very demanding full time jobs and we knew we had a tight budget, we made a list of everything we needed/ wanted. This allowed both of us to look and respond to posts without having to text or call the other. 

What we sourced:
- Clothes 0-3 and 3-6 months 
- Pack and play 
- Bouncers 
- Walker 
- Swings (two different kids) 
- Breast pumps and parts

My husband is way more tech savvy and loves to search through sites. So we were able to successfully source the entire list above as well as: 
- a changing table with silicone change pad 
- diaper bag 
- new elephant basket with new baby toys 
- baby blankets 

It takes time so start early! 

These site will continue to help you parent on a budget as your child/ children grow.
