Since studying psychology and cognitive science, people and relations have always interested me. I look at parenting as an experiment that we are conducting for a lifetime - never perfect but striving to get it right in as few tries as possible. Everyone has good and bad memories that they relate back to their upbringing. Whether it is food, smell, or a scar both physical or emotional. I feel our upbringings 100% effect who we are today. 

I was raised by a very strong single mother, she put my brother and me above herself until the day she passed. I know no matter what, if I called, she would answer. If I asked her to be somewhere, she would move mountains to be there.  She pushed me to strive for perfection, be determined and persistent to reach success. 

As my life went on, I feel like I have always studied parents. I have watched other parents quietly talk to, love and hold their children, on the counter I have seen parents yell, scream and hit there child. I have sat back and watch parenting is something that scared the crap out of me. Once I found out I was pregnant with my first I read TONS of articles, journals, blog whatever I could dine on parenting. Thanks for the global pandemic I had way too much time to freak myself out. Once I had my little bundle I relayed on my instance to guid me. Some things I thought and planned flew out the window and a let the child guide us side of me came out.  

Koala parenting or the 7 B's 
Birth bonding: snuggle, cuddle and love. 
Breastfeeding: love the contact time,  neural and healthy connection this can lead to. 
Babywearing: they get to be close, feel/ hear your heart beat and you can get a little workout in! I still hold and carry my two year old around. 
Bedding close to the baby: let's be honest that precious sight of a child sleeping is priceless. I soak up every moment of it for as long as they want to cuddle and snuggle with me. 
Belief in the babyâ€™s cry: I feel a baby's cry is for a  reason even if they reason is they just want to be held. I have defiantly lost more sleep than most, worked out my back and arms more than some but I do have to say I love that my littles will walk and crawl to me knowing I am a safe place. 
Balance and boundaries: being a baby/ toddler is hard. I imagine trying to express myself when I don't know the language would be really difficult. I create a  
Beware of baby trainers: teaching is different than training. I teach my children things and follow their lead. 

My mantra "they will only be today year old today"embrace today, the fun moments and the challenges. 

The things I never planned for but absolutely LOVE! 
I contact sleep whenever they want(currently I have both children cuddling me), I hug and cuddle them whenever they want. 

I tell them I love them everyday, physical touches of love everyday, a hug, a kiss on the head or nose. 

My child is not my equal but I do respect them, what they wants and how they feel.  I say my please and thank you to them. I ask permission. I share with them and bring them  snacks. I want my oldest do all these things with her brother and to us. 

When its time for a snack I usually ask what they want or give two options, but not a free for all of the kitchen. 

there is no hard cut off for eating or drinking. I get hungry and thirsty after dinner why wouldn't they. 

I HATE when littles sing the  "NO NO NO" song. its nails on a chalk board for me. So.... I try my best not to say no to my toddler. Before you roll your eyes, if you know me I run a tight ship. I use other ways and world to say no. "I heard you, but right now we cannot do that because... but we can do it tomorrow" "thank you for letting you know you want more milk but we are out, would you like to go to Costco with me this afternoon to get more" "I know you want to play with your Appa, but he is working. Let's play together then after dinner you can play with your Appa" you get the picture, I say no in more words. this also teaches them more words so its a win win to me. She gains knowledge and I don't have to hear the dreaded "NO NO NO" song.
