When I say free samples I mean FREE samples. When I was pregnant  with my first I started to search for free samples so I could test out products on my little incase she had allergies or sensitivities. As I was searching I found many companies say free samples when you pay for shipping and handling, well that means those samples cost you whatever the shipping is. The list below are the complies I used and I paid NOTHING for them! It took me about 20 minutes to set all of them up and the samples came rolling in. 


**Registries:**
- Walmart - this was the best one I received for my second. It is easy to set up and is sent directly to your house. 
- Target -  targets was a pain in the you know what to receive. But it has some of the best coupons that will be loaded directly to your app. It also has samples from brands like hello bello that I do not receive elsewhere. 
- Amazon - this one is one of the easiest to receive, but varies significantly.  In 2020 it was one of the best sample boxes but in 2022 it was the worst one. 
Freebies without a registry: 
- Enfamil - they send two cans of formula and continue to send coupons as your little gets bigger. 
- Similac - will send coupons throughout your child's first year of life. They say they send samples but I never received any for either of my children.
- Huggies & Pampers - both of these companies have apps that you can use to scan in your diaper purchases to earn rewards (coupons and freebies)  

Honorary mention: Dolly Parton imagination library- it is not in our area but it 100% is a wonderful organization to help all children with literacy. This organization is doing big things and I highly recommend checking to see if your area qualifies you for a free monthly book for your little. 

Why did I sign up for formula companies when I planned to breastfeed: truth, because very few things in my life have gone as planned so I wanted a back up plan. Which I am SO thankful for. Both of my kids lost too much weight the first few days and needed more than what I could nurse/pump, so these backup can’s came in handy. 

Benefits of these companies in addition to the free samples: 
Target - just  create a baby registry and make it public. Then go into any target and go into customer service and ask( they are often out) you can also try to get it online through the registry when you make an order over $30 you just pay $.05. With both kids they didn’t scan my phone in store, so I was able to get one in store and one online. 
You also will get a coupon for 15% off. It can be used once in store and once online for items on your registry. Because I have winter babies I put loads of holiday gifts,  clothes for all of us and some food. The discount worked for almost everything. 

Amazon - create a registry then once someone ( could be you) purchase $30 or more then you can go in and ship the welcome box to yourself for free. Michael and I both have Amazon accounts and we both could do this. 

Walmart - create a registry then you have to go to a special Walmart baby box site and enter your information including the url from your registry. Then it will be shipped to you. No purchase required. I sent the Walmart baby box to a few friends and neighbors addresses to really optimize on the samples. You could consider sending it to your parents address then have them bring it or ship the content to you.

#### **Benefits**: You received a 15% discount that can be used twice on select leftover baby registry items. The discount becomes available before your due date, so you can stock up on baby items before your bundle arrives. You can also use the second discount after your little one has arrived. There are many more benefits not listed but you do need to read the fine print.
