I often see myself as a frugal stay-at-home mom, but I do splurge when feeding my coffee addiction. There is something nice about walking to our local Starbucks and embracing your hands around a grande caramel macchiato when everything else in the day seems to be going wrong or the nights never ends.

As a special/healthy treat for my little, I let her get water, which makes her feel included in the family ritual. But, all the plastic waste for a little water? Distasteful.

So, my family washes and keeps the cups for different activities and play.  Whether for:
- sorting pom poms
- playing at our water table 
- watering the plants 
- harvesting tomatoes 
- planting jalapeños (poke some holes and let things grow)
- crafting
- or reusing them for a house brewed cup on the go. 

Our family embraces reuse ♻️!
