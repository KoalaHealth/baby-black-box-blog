Potty training is a very individual milestone. There are loads of books and blogs giving advice on potty training. This is our journey... 

I started to have the toddler toilet around the house when she was 18 month old. I spoke to her doctor and she advised to wait until she was 2 years 3 months especially because we would be introducing a new born into the family around her 2nd birthday. By putting the toilet out it allowed her to get comfortable with it and in the 9 months that we had it out she used it on and off quite a bit. Now that it is time to officially start her training process I have to plan/prepare, stuck to it, celebrate the success and make it fun. 

Plan/prepare: plan how, when, and where you are going to potty train. How are you going to train, are you going to use toddler toilets or go straight to the big toilet. Are you going to potty train during the days only or are you going to do naps and nights as well. Are you going to do the naked from waste down technique or just skip the diapers and put them in dresses, shorts or pants. Once you have this planned. Set a date that works for your house and figure out where you want to put the toddler toilets ( if you are using them) and where will you need extra’s ( extra shorts or pants in your diaper bag, extra blankets, towels, sheets etc. 
Stuck to it:  once you start, stick with it. Loads of research shows that children do better with consistency and schedules. So once you decide as a parent it is time then devote the days needed to give your little the best chance of success. I defiantly had moments of frustration. 
Be there biggest cheerleader:  this is new and very different for your little, so celebrating all the big and little wins will ease any stress they might be feeling. It also gives you a fun reason to smile in the mists of pee, and poop galore. 
Don’t let others control your journey: where we live the summers get hot, I felt very strongly against restricting my littles water intake for 12 hours at night. So I do use pull ups(night time underwear) at night and let things ride for naps. The biggest thing to remember is this is your little journey and you are the support person. The more you help them and follow there lead the easier it will be. If you try to force them into a special path it might not work and it will be stressful for everyone involved. 


Make it fun- 
1. Song: come up with something that works for you. It sounds silly but I found coming up with a potty training song adds some fun smiles to the process. We use "Pee pee, pee pee in the potty. You went pee pee pee in the potty. We sit on the potty to go pee and poop. 
2. Dance: sometimes she has the feeling of pee or I need her to go before we head out. So I sit her on the potty, sing the song and sometimes do a little dance. “Dancing” is more of a clap your hands if you are a big girl who goes pee and poop in the toilet. We also do a stomp your feet. Right foot once left foot twice and go back and forth learning numbers and her right and left. I started to do thing to keep her on the potty and to distract her so she can go pee. 
3. Make the flush fun:  Buy buy to the pee and poop. We wave to the pee and poop as we toss it in the toilet and flush.  I also let her dump the pee/ poop in the potty and flush the toilet. 

Potty training is gross and nasty: okay if you made it this far I’m going to be totally transparent, I thought it was gross and nasty. I hated having to touch the little potty and the smell of poop or cleaning up an opps we didn’t make it pee. But it is part of the process and better than a poop that has been smashed on a butt. I have added gloves, puppy pads and toilet inserts to the list that helped me get though this phase, but are totally not a need. 

Noteworthy: 
Naps: I (try) to get her to go to the bathroom before laying down for her nap and I hope she will last. Some times she does have accidents and we roll with it. I just say “oh that’s okay you must have slept super well. Let's sit on the potty and try to pee as mama cleans up.”
