excerpt: 'Baby shark...'
---

My 6 month old is teething, so he is gumming everything. My face to my unsuspecting husband's toes - nothing is safe from my baby's slobber.

My older toddler is mimicking but thinks he is biting. We've been lightly reprimanding as we catch her. We had it under controlâ€¦or so I thought.

I had my 6 month old on my lap and my toddler was playing with him. A total sweet angel of an older sister. I looked away for a moment and CHOMP. My little dinosaur of a daughter tried to bite off her brother's finger. The poor little guy let out a blood curdling scream and looked at me with the "you-betrayed-me" face.

Again, my Mama guilt came over me. My poor sweet baby boy did nothing! You could see the signs of my daughter's betrayal - a perfect bite mark on his tiny little finger.

Any other moms have guilt biting stories? I am in going through it!
