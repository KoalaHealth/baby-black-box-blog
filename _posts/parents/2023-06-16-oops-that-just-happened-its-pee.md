excerpt: "That's a lot of pee..."
---

So...my oldest is in the thick of potty training. For the most part, she's doing great. Most of the time, she runs off and pees in her little potty then pops back up and on with her life. My husband and I empty the "plastic throne" whenever we see "new occupants." Great for me. Not so great for her crawling little brother. 

Recently, my curious little guy crawled over to the toddler potty and flipped it on top of himself. Dripping from head to toe in pee, he had this look like "mama, I did bad." Definitely a second child moment.
