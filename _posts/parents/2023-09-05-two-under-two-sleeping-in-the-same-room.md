## Why I had my kids share a room from day two

When we welcomed our second child into the world, the juggle of where everyone sleeps went into motion. We live in a two bedroom apartment, so we could have put our new born in our room and left my toddler in her own room. BUT, my husband works from home and well into the night, so the screens would not be conducive to a healthy sleeping environment for the new born. 

So, we went for what seemed to be the natural route, and that is having my two littles in the same room from day two. I would put the newborn down to sleep then (my husband or I would) play with my toddler down stairs (soaking in the one-to-one time). When it was time for bed, we would sneak back upstairs and cuddle until she fell asleep. 

For those of you who think this is somewhat hectic and super difficult, you are 100% right! The first week was really, really tough. As a light sleeper, my toddler would wake up whenever my newborn would stir awake. Not only that, she wanted me to cuddle her back to sleep. At some points, I had both children screaming because they wanted me absolutely present. I only got through it by reminding myself "this is a phase and it too shall end," and it did end.

Now, the family has found our groove. My toddler curls up behind me and rubs my back to fall asleep, while I nurse the newborn from the front. A mama sandwich!
After the first week, my toddler became a much heavier sleeper and now only wakes up a few times a night.

6 month in, they both LOVE to cuddle and sleep together. They nap and play together. My toddler created a little nest next to her brother's pack-n-play with her stuffed animals and will ask to sleep there so her head can be close to her brother. It was 100% worth the tough week and stressful moments to watch their bond grow and their sleep habits strengthen. 

Good luck Mamas you can do it, too!
