Why my kids have room shared from day two. 
When we welcomed our second child into the world the complex juggle of where everyone sleeps went into motion. We live in a two bedroom apartment, so we could have put our new born in our room and leave my toddler in her own room. BUT my husband works from home and works well into the night, so the screens would not be conducive to a healthy sleep environment for the new born. 

So we went for the what seemed to be the easy route, and that is having my two littles in the same room from day two. I would put the newborn down then play with my toddler down stairs (soaking in the one on one time), when it was time for bed we would sneak in and cuddle until she fell asleep. 
For those of you who think this is crazy and super difficult you are 100% right! the first week was really really tough, my toddler is a super light sleeper so every time the newborn would wake up she would wake up too and she wanted to lay with me to cuddle. At some points I had both children screaming because they wanted me and I remember thinking "this is a phase and it too shall end" and it did end. we found our groove. My toddler would curl up behind me and rub my back then go back to sleep as I nursed the newborn back to sleep. 
After that first week, my toddler became a way heavier sleeper and really only wakes up a few times, half of which have nothing to do with the newborn and the newborn sleeps like a tank. 

6 month later, they both LOVE to cuddle and sleep together. They nap together, my toddler created a little nest next to the pack and play with her stuffed animals and will ask to sleep there so her head can be close to her brother. It was 100% worth the tough week and stressful moments to watch their bond grow and there sleep habits strengthen. 

Good luck Mama's you can do it!
