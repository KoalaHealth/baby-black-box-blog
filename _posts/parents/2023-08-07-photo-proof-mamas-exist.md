excerpt: 'I wish mamas could get more photos with their children!'

Being an active, stay-at-home mother is hard!  On top of the inescapable minutes nurturing and protecting, we often play the role of the conscientious, unappreciated historian and photographer.

We mothers are ever-present in our children’s experiences but never seen.  

This used to bother me, but now, instead of spending the limited energy being upset, I focus on figuring out how to get at least some form of “photo evidence” to prove I was there and I was an active parent. 

I do think it is super common for many spouses to just not think about taking photos of a mother with their child. Hurtful. In the thousands of photos taken, there are probably 20 photos of my husband+children to every one photo of me in the frame. 

Even the photos I have with my oldest are those first precious months when we were napping together.... cute but only a small snapshot of the wonderful things we did together. To give my husband some credit, I recognize my husband had a lot on his plate, so instead of nagging, I took the matter into my own hands. 

- I take selfies.
- I have a tripod.
- I lovingly remind him to take photos.
- I put family photo shoots on the calendar, so my husband actively focuses on photo taking.

I have to say still to this day I have so many awesome photos of my husband and the kids that I cherish. I have many selfie-style photos of me and the kids that help record my presence in their milestones. For now, this is fine, but I hope to improve it with my husband over time.
