excerpt: "That's a lot of poo..."
---

So...I am a believer in naked time. I think it is great for the child to naturally to air out and reduce diaper rash.

The other day, my little one was enjoying his free play time while my oldest was bopping around in her kitchen - just enough seconds for my husband and I to reflect on our progress and "talk shop."Â That second, my oldest started yelling "mama mama mama.  mama baby caca."

It was a crime scene. My husband looked over and my little guy had "cleared out" yellow poo poo (caca) all over my floor (thank you for wood floors). Lets just say it was a "save the wipes, put them in the shower" kind of moment. After a shower and a deep floor clean, my dramatic husband looked me in the eyes to say "my hands will never be the same."
