My whole life I have known my family has had a hard time carrying pregnancies to term. I have always been honest with myself that my journey to motherhood might look very different than most. Knowing this, I did things to try to prepare myself for this personal journey. This is how I organized all of my preparations down into 4 sections. 

1. **Get healthy** - I have always been a workaholic, and for many years was on the C diet (Coffee, Carrots and Carbs). Looking to start the next chapter of my life I knew going to the gym was not always going to be  in the cards for me. For the few years before trying to get pregnant I made sure physical activity was something that was in my day to day life. I would go on quick walks during my lunch break, I would take the stairs,  I would stop by the gym or rock climbing wall on my way home from work. But most of all i would make sure i would move on the weekends, between hiking, walking, surfing, doing some at home body weight workouts i constantly tried to do  things to get by blood flowing.


2. **Take prenatals/vitamins (prenatal, calcium+ vitamin D)** - i am someone who has a history of getting sick after taking vitamins. So I found a prenatal that I liked about 2 years before getting pregnant, this allowed my body to get used to them well before the horrible first trimester hormones made everything come back up.  I also started to take a calcium supplement because I only drank milk with coffee and cereal so I knew for my own bone health I needed to take something. Nerd alert: studies have shown that there are health benefits to starting a prenatal while trying to conceive, so just start taking them and stay on them. 

3. **Try to enjoy the process** - trying to conceive can be difficult. For both of my pregnancies it did not go as planned and took longer than I expected. If you think about it you have 12 chances to get pregnant a year and as someone who had super irregular cycles tracking my ovulation was almost impossible. I did use over the counter ovulation strips to try and help track/ figure out my cycle. Also , before my husband and I got married we were both open to adopt if we could not conceive by the time I was 32. Knowing we had a plan B that we were both very happy with brought peace to the process. 


4. **Practice quick and easy dinner/lunch meals**.  Eating healthy is key from trying to conceive to being postpartum to nourishing a baby and starting their food journey. So as someone who was split on my plan to go back to work after my maternity leave was up or stay home. For the years preceding giving birth to my first I had a blast practicing new recipes that would make a quick healthy meal for the family. I started to research ingredients that would be healthy for everyone and found ways to slip those ingredients into our day to day diets. This was honestly one of the biggest and best things I did to prepare for pregnancy and the new chapter of our life as a family of 3 then 4. 


Life is hard and being pregnant while working is even harder so if you are thinking about having a baby or in the middle of the process you probably have a million things on your mind. I hope these 4 sections can help guide you while removing all the fluff you see online.
