Potatoes are little pirate chests - easily forgettable/lost and fun to hunt. 

Three years ago I found myself with some forgotten potatoes in the pantry. The *eyes* were just starting to form so I thought, "why not plant them and see what happens."

As spring came around, my daughter loved the potato hunt! Now, every year we plant potatoes in the summer and harvest them as the plants wither. Each year, the kids forget we planted them and have a blast digging them up.

It's not about the harvest but the joy it brings while dirt goes flying and the harvest is found.
