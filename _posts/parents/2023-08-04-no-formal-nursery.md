When we were pregnant with our first, we lived in a small one bedroom apartment, and my husband worked from home. This made the juggle of home, work and newborn a very tricky thing. We did have space in our room to do a small nursery corner for her, but I chose not to. This is why:

1. It is expensive 
2. I felt I was doing it for me, not really for my daughter
3. I would rather spend the time and money to create a dream room when she is older, so we can build memories doing it together. 
4. Why would I hang something heavy right above my child's bed? Living in an earthquake zone, this absolutely terrifies me (a bit extra and paranoid, but it's the truth).
5. How long will the little one really enjoy the room? As she was my first, I really had no idea, but based on what I found online, she would only enjoy it for a very brief time, if at all.

For me, number 5 was the final reason that sealed my plan to not setup a formal nursery or nursery section in our apartment. Here is the sliding timeline I compiled as a first time mama:

- **0-6 months**: it is recommended to have the newborn "room share," so they won't be in the nursery. 
- **6-18 months**: they sleep in their crib and hopefully don't climb out (so they will enjoy the nursery)
- **18-24 months**: they are transitioned out of their crib to something else. So you have to baby proof/sleep proof their rooms. All those cute little lights, wall decorations, etc. will now have to be removed or moved. To me, spending that amount of time and money for a year's enjoyment seems like a lot. 


As a second time mom, my opnion hasn't changed much. I still feel this list is valid and am glad I did not spend the money on a formal nursery. I am all about creating memories and not wasting money. But, I look forward to the day my children and I customize my kids' room.
