There is nothing like the purity and genuine reactions of a child to refocus your priorities.

This morning we went for a family run, which was followed-up with a play session at the park.  In that "down period" of watching my kids play, I noticed my unshaven+ashy legs, mismatched socks, hole-y sweatshirt, and my thigh dimples on full display under my short running shorts.  Ugh.

Then I looked up again at my littles who were hopping around on the play structure and going from one slide to another. They were having the absolute time of their lives.  My oldest was so happy. All she had wanted to do that morning was go running with me and my husband then play in the park.

In that slice of life, the world was perfect. And, at least in that moment, it was ok to look like a hot mess.
