excerpt: 'Garden potting soil betrayed me...'
---

Welp, this just happened! I let my 6 month old play in the potting soil as I was planting my first family garden. I thought she looked super cute gardening with mama and was doing such a great job not eating the soil. That's until I realized how many micro splinters she had... Poor little baby has splinters all over her arms and legs. 

After freaking out about potential (highly improbable) infection, I picked every barely visible splinter out with tweezers and ran her a warm bath. 

My poor little one now has little red bumps where her the pesky splinters irritated. As guilty as I feel, this was an honest oops. I am just praying nothing turns into a bigger infection.

Happy planting!
