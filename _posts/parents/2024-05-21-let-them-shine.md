Uniqueness is the spice of life. Give them room to express their spunk! Let them shine!

To my future daughter,


 I see,  a little girl who woke up ready to run and be outside. She ate all her breakfast, got herself dressed, picked out her brothers clothes, helped everyone get on there shoes, patiently (or not so patiently ) waited in the stroller for us to finished our run, so she could run our cool down and play in the park. she is a proud little girl who is living her best life. I asked if i could help and adjust her sweeter which she said no, so i let her rock it. I refuse to dim that shine! 

before becoming a parent i would have probably giggled and though"why not help her" now that i'm a mama i will protect that shine as long as i can!
