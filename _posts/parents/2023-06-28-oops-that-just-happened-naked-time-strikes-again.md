excerpt: "That's a lot of poo and pee..."
---

Welp...these days, I have a love and hate relationship naked time. My poopy little guy was airing out, sans diaper. All of a sudden I heard a "toot." From the smell, it was right off the back of a turd.

So, I popped up from my criss-cross apple sauce and tried to unbutton his three-snap onesie (which I had stupidly snapped together) as I ran to the bathroom. I made it into the bathroom as the final snap popped loose. With the strength of an aspiring Olympic gymnast, my little pushed off the toilet seat with his foot pivoting his body so the explosion landed right outside the toilet. It didn't end there. 

As I tried to sit him down to finish, he ended up pooping down his legs, all over the seat and a few little pathetic drops in the bowl. I started laughing so hard I ended up peeing myself as I held my very poopy little guy over the toilet, who began to cry. 

Another "save the wipes lets just go to the shower moment." Also, my husband could have a wonderful career in hazardous waste management.
