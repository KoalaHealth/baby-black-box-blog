excerpt: "Let them jump in the puddle!"
---

Being outside is my family’s form of therapy. The past few weeks have been filled with rain and crisp weather. But, as my mother used to say, “skin is easy to clean, let the kids live.” So, take every opportunity to enjoy jumping in puddles, breathing in the fresh crisp air, and sharing giggles and wiggles as a family. 

We hope you and your family are staying safe this unusual winter season!
