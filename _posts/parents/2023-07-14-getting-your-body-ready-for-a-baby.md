Carrying a baby is a natural thing, magically enough most of the time your body knows what to do on its own but as the host I found it important to try and help my body through the process. Thank you doctor google. I was terrified of the horror stories I had read about online from pregnant mothers and postpartum mothers. So as part of my prenatal process I tried to focus on 7 tips (I know more than my normal list but they all have a key point I promise )  to be totally transparent. I failed at most of these sections throughout parts of my pregnancy journey but I never gave up, and that is key! 


1. **Supplements** -  Find a prenatal and calcium supplement you like and your body is okay with. Once you have start taking them right away and say on them 

2. **Pelvic floor** - pregnancy= vaginas ripping open, prolaps, leakage, never being able to sneeze, cough or laugh without checking your pants… or does it!  In my 20’s i went to a stanford lecture  from a processor who was focusing on the pelvic floor. When I left the 2 hour lecture I remember thinking welp that is birth control! Adoption is sounding fantastic. After a few months the terrible stories i heard started to fade and the baby fever started to kick in. Let's just say i kegeled my way through traffic to and from work everyday after that lecture and I started testing out pelvic floor workout on youtube. I am not a professional and truly have no idea which ones make a big difference but either way you will get a workout and hopefully it helps your pelvic floor strengthen and all your lady bits stay strongly in place. 

3. **Be your version of healthy** - this does not mean run a marathon everyday (no one has time for that), completely cut out sugar, carbs and everything good in life or have a “perfect 6 pack”.  For me this was making sure I moved/ got my heartrate up everyday and drank tons of water. Like gallons of water, your skin will thank you or me. 

4. **Eat healthy but don't let it affect your mental health** - as someone who survived many years off coffee, I can now say this is not healthy. For any part of your body, from your skin, teeth, gut and just overall health. Here are some small things I did that made a huge difference. Switch to water after 2 to 3  cups of caffeinated beverages. Cut out alcohol or limit to 1 glass every few weeks/ months. Add fruits and vegetables, if you already regularly eat them challenge yourself to eat more.  Find new fun recipes focusing on what is in season  that spice up veggies. In full disclosure I never know what is in season, so I subscribed to my local farmers market email list and now every few weeks they tell me, it's the perfect hack for a busy person.   

5. **Body weight exercises for your arm** -  Babies are heavy! Those cute little 5-12lb things seem so light and fragile day one but after hours of picking them up, putting them down, soothing them, backing them around they get heavy. I remember with my first one of the appointments she weighed in at 12lbs and i was shocked i thought to myself  are you kidding me only 12 lbs i’m weak.  But with the lack of sleep or break your cute chucky thing will start to fatigue your arms, back and overall body. I wish I would have done more pushups, planks, dips and simple at home body weight exercises to prepare for my first.  

6. **Prepare your back** - my back went through hell while pregnant, i put on 40lbs which is a lot, i shut down my hotel which ment stripping beds, cleaning trash, doing laundry, then i had to move my HR office twice which meant carrying endless amounts of boxes filled with paper back and forth, up and down a 9 story 300+ room hotel. I did not prepare my back for this, when I was 7 months pregnant I started having horrible sciatica. I could not sit, stand, or lay without being in pain. This pain is something I deal with still to this day. If i could go back i would 100% have stretched, done workouts to strengthen all the muscle groups. 

7. **Practice proper lifting & turning** - this goes with preparing your back but whether you are pregnant or postpartum your back, legs and arms go through a lot. You will be constantly picking up the little one for the next 4-5 years of their cute little lives. With everyday there weight does up and an opps can cause some damage to your body. So always remember to lift with your knees and DON’T do a quick twist with just your soldiers. Your future body will thank you. 



Your body is about to be stretched, pushed, kicked, bit, pushed, pulled, possibly ripped and torn. Hope these 7 tips can help ease the stress on you and your body.
