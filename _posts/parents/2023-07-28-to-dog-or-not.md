excerpt: 'Dogs can be wonderful for children, but they need your love, energy, and time, too.'

My husband and I are dog-people. We had dogs for as long as we can remember. We always wanted our children to have their own "fuzzy, lovable partners in crime." It's a recurring conversation in our family that recently came up again. Here is our current list of pros and cons: 


We are considering many breeds but many share some requirements/specific needs : 

- They need room to get there unless energy out. They must be exercised/run.
- They are very smart, so must be worked.
- Very dominant dog, so a strong alpha is required or they will think they are the alpha, which also makes them fiercely loyal.
- Must be regularly socialized, as they are very protective. 

**Pro:**
- Great for the kids' health/immune system, it lessens the chance they will be allergic later in life. 
- Would force us to run again and get the kids out of the house. We already do take time kids for a walk, run and/or park time every day so this is a lifestyle we already practice.
- Our 2 year old has had "chores" for about a year now so adding feeding/watering a dog would be an age appropriative addition to the things she can do. 
- Having the puppy training phase complete before we move into something we might own or a bigger place would be nice (I would rather not have to deal with repainting or having the dog chew a new to us sofa). 

**Cons:**
- As a family of four we live in a two bedroom apartment, so space is on the tighter side and we have a patio but no yard. 
- We don't have family locally with animals so I will have to intentionally socialize the puppy at a park with the kids, which is going to be an active, balancing act. 
- I am a stay-at-home mom with a 2 under 3. Between all the meltdowns, toys, yelling, winning, adding a barking, toy chewing puppy, peeing/pooping (children and puppy) to the mix just seem overwhelming at the moment.


After a pretty quick conversation, the puppy has been punted for another year. My husband and I have always been in agreement on the breed of dog we want. We want the dog to have a good life. We currently feel the life we have would not be fair to the puppy/dog. Personally I feel like most of the responsibility will fall on me as I am home (100% okay with that). Right now with my youngest being so small, I feel like they still need my full attention. I am hoping once my oldest is a bit older and my little can walk and get around more on his own this will allow me the ability to comfortable have room to train the dog. 

What do you think? should we move up the timeline or do you think we are making the right choice to re evaluate in another year?
