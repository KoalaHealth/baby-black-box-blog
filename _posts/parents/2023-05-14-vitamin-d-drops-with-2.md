If I thought remembering Vitamin D drops for <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/vitamin-d-drops">my first was hard</a>, it was eeeven harder adding my second child. My attention was so split with two. As they say, “out of sight, out of mind.” Keeping it in the medicine cabinet was just not going to work. But I couldn’t put it too close where sticky baby fingers can go.

So, I started putting it in the middle of the dining table. The bottle was visible every day where I need it but not too close that a two year old could snatch it.

I don’t beat myself up if I forget. I focus on being better tomorrow than being upset about yesterday. What do you think?
