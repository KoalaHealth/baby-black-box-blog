excerpt: "Cuddle today. Laundry tomorrow."
---

You cannot "spoil" your baby when they are a few months old. I feel like it is all about socially treating a baby like they are a teenage. You can find blogs and videos of people potty training a 3 month old and sleep training at 3-4 months. To the parents out there who are wanting to contact sleep, cuddle and hold their baby - DO IT!!! There is time later to sleep train, potty train, and do the laundry. I tell my husband all the time, she will only be this old today so we need to soak it in. Plus, nothing beats that sweet little kiss you can give your little ones head when they are asleep.
