I struggled to produce breast milk.  It's hard to share, but many women have challenges.  This is the advice I got from our medical "lactation specialist."  Pump, pump, and pump some more.

Breast pumping signals to your body that there is a need to produce more milk, so if done regularly, your body can naturally increase breast milk production.

So, while I was pregnant, my husband sourced 2 spectra breast pumps and a medela pump with extra parts.

This is my advice: get extra breast pump parts, if you are pumping.

I wanted to be a good mother, so I pumped about 8 times a day, EVERY DAY, for the first 3 months of my daughter's life. I then transitioned to 2-3 times a day for another 3 months. The extra parts allowed my husband some time to rest between dish washes and dries. Plus, I could use two flanges and two bottles and pump both breasts at the same time.

The idea of extra pump parts might sound silly, but if you are are not a stay-at-home with a super smmoth breastfeeding journey, extra parts can save you and your husband a little extra energy. My journey was unfortunately not smooth, so the extra parts let me pump 7 times before doing a big wash and dry.

We all hope your journey is smooooth!
