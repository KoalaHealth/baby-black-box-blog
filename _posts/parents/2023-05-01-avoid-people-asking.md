1. **Baby wear!!!** This means slings, pouches, backpacks... Honestly it’s amazing!!! And the more kids you have, the more acceptable it is. 

2. **The sit with us.** Put a blanket down and sit with the baby on the floor so they can play. When someone approaches with that "I-want-to-hold-your-baby look," just say "oh hey, sit with us." It's very effective. It's about riding the wave, not fighting it. 

3. **The poop change.** Thanks to the poop machines, I can use the "oh let me change him/her," then circle to another group afterward. I also don’t let anyone change my kids either other than my husband and me. Sensing a pattern? Like I said, you do you. Listen to your good judgment. 

4. **The "we tried."** If my kid cries when someone is holding them I *100%* take my kid back, especially if they say "no, it's ok - babies need to cry." The next time they ask to hold them I just say "no, it’s okay."

5. **The practice makes perfect (don't hold my kid).** Once they start walking, my go-to is  "they need to practice, you can walk with them and make sure they don’t fall." This is especially effective with those older kids that want to start picking them up.
