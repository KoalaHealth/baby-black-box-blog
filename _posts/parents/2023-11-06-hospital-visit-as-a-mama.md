Super Mamas are never supposed to get sick or hurt - right? Well, like many multitasking mamas early in the morning, I messed up. Here is what happened.

While chopping veggies for salsa, managing two energetic children, and planning out the day in my head, I overdid the "chop" and took a bit of my finger off with the cilantro. Ouch.

I acted quickly and summoned my husband to drive me to the hospital. After a whirlwind to round up the children, we were off.

But, when I arrived at the emergency room, I was surprised to learn from the nurses that my littles were too young to be in the waiting room with me. Oof. So, my husband took this opportunity to tackle some errands.

To make matters worse, it took 4 hours of waiting, assessment, and treatment before I was released from the emergency department. This would have been fine if not for my breastfed baby. Unhappy would be an understatement.

When I reached my family in the parked car, I found one "cracker-shoveling" child, one crying infant, and a husband that looked liked he had gone through the ringer. My poor, bedraggled husband looked to be on the verge of cracking.
Thank goodness my little was not a newborn.

But, I began to wonder, what would I have done with a newborn? Would I have pushed back when the nurse said no children, or simply started formula?

What do you think? What would you do?

Remember, plan ahead and know your children. A little forethought can go a long way to easing a family trip. You can do it, too!
