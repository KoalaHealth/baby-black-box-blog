I work so I can spend more time and raise my children.  This unfortunatley means I have less time than I want to spend with the kiddos.

Whether you have a spouse, fellow guardian, or are flying solo, I try to get as much done and ready for the little ones whenever I have the energy.  Most days I'm going all out and pushing until my energy is empty, but over time, like a muscle, I've found I can push through more and more.

Like my policy on good dating, I work to think ahead, consider what the other would want, and enjoy the good and bad moments.  I figure with my kids, they're only going to want to hug me until they make their first friend in preschool.

Fasten your seatbelts and enjoy the ride!
