excerpt: "Make delicious homemade bread crumbs, because no bread goes to waste in our house!"
---

Breadcrumbs are the simplest, and one of the most overlooked pantry staple, you never have when you need them. Well, this recipe should help change that! By repurposing old bread that would otherwise end up in the waste, we can make delicious homemade breadcrumbs that can be frozen and eaten in many ways. 


### Ingredient

- Bread crusts or loafed bread (sliced and diced into pieces)


### Directions

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 1</h5>
Preheat oven to 300°F and line large baking sheet. 

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 2</h5>
Crumble bread crumbs into desired small pieces (usually, smaller the better). To crumble, you can place the crust in a food processor or pull the crust apart into tiny little pieces by hand. 

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 3</h5>
Place bread crumbles in an even layer on the prepared baking sheet.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 4</h5>
Place in oven and bake for 5 minutes.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 5</h5>
Remove from oven, immediately toss on the tray, and then bake for another 5 minutes. If the crumbs are not golden brown, bake them for another 1 to 5 minutes (use your good judgment). 

**Allow crumbs to cool then use them or store them in an airtight container (good for 1 week in the fridge or 3 months in the freezer).**
