In 30 minutes, you should have a flaky, crunchy cheesy delight to sink your teeth into. Once it's cool, your toothless little can suck/mash and enjoy it, too! 

### Ingredients

- 8 ounces sharp cheddar cheese (extra sharp works too) *cold, straight from fridge*
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter *cold, straight from fridge*
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (optional)
- 1 cup all-purpose flour (whole wheat also works)
- 2-3 tablespoons ice water

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F.
2. Line baking sheet with parchment paper.
3. Take the cheese and butter out of the refrigerator and cut into small cubes.
4. Add cheese into the bowl of a stand mixer and beat on medium speed (level 6 on kitchenaid) for about 30 seconds. 
5. Cheese will break down and become creamy mixture. Turn mixer off and scrape down the sides of the bowl.
6. Turn mixer back on to medium-high speed and add butter. Mix for another 30-45 seconds until cheese and butter cream together. (cream until you no longer see chunks of cheese).
6. Turn the mixer to low speed, then slowly add in the flour.
7. Once all the flour has been added, turn the mixer to medium-high speed and beat for another 30 seconds until all flour has been incorporated. (texture should be dry and crumbly)
8. Turn the mixer back on to low speed and add the ice water. 1 tablespoon at a time (I usually use 1 to 2 tablespoons of water). Depending on the cheese and climate/temperature, you might need to add up to 3 tablespoons. You want the dough to feel solid but soft (similar to play-doh) and be able to roll it out without it sticking to everything.
9. Sprinkle a little flour on your parchment paper, place dough in the center and slowly flatten with your hands to make a thick disk. 
10. Using a rolling pin, roll dough until it is about 1/16th inch thick. 
11. Once rolled out, use a sharp knife (or pizza cutter) cut into 1 inch squares or desired shapes. 
12. Transfer crackers to a baking sheet. Make sure you space out the crackers so they have space to rise.
13. (optional) Sprinkle with kosher salt. I sprinkle salt on some for my husband, but keep some salt free for the kids.
14. Bake 10-15 minutes, baking time varies based on thickness, shape and size. Baking tip: all ovens cook differently so keep checking crackers after the 10 minute mark. Edges should start to brown but still orange overall.
15. Allow to cool for 2-3 minutes if they are not crunchy, place them back in the oven for 1-3 minutes.

#### Bakers notes: 
- Cheese and butter MUST be cold and straight out of the fridge. 
- My kids I love when I cut these into different shapes. My 7 month old loves rectangles and my toddler loves triangles and squares. 
- Real butter, you must use real butter to achieve the flakey texture 
- Store in fridge or freezer: best if consumed in the first 4-6 hours, after that I recommend sorting in fridge or freezer.
