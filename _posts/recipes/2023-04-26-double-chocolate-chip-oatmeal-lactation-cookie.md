Recipe notes:
They are perfect to satisfy a chocolate craving or the midnight boost you need as a sleep deprived mom.  If you would like them a bit sweeter try upping the maple syrup to ½ cup.  Happy feeding ladies!!
Stored in fridge for 5 days or freeze for up to 3 months. I love to keep them in the freezer and pull out a few at a time throughout the day. They will thaw quickly on the counter.
Author notes:
I had a very rough start to my breastfeeding journey, on my mission to get my breastmilk to come in and catch up to the needs of my newborn I was desperate to try anything. As a mom on a budget I started to create my own cookie that not only tasted great but gave my body the boost it needed to create liquid gold. Hope these help your journey.

### Directions

#### Step 1
Either leave 1 1/2 cups of milk at room temperature or warm milk for about 30 seconds.  Pour into large metal bowl.

#### Step 2
Melt 1/3 cup of butter in microwave and add to milk.

#### Step 3
Add 2 eggs, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon salt, 4 teaspoons baking powder, and 2 tablespoons white sugar and mix.

#### Step 4
Slowly add and mix 2 cups of all-purpose flour as you mix.

#### Personal Preference
We like to cook the waffles on setting 2, which cooks the waffles before it becomes crunchy.  Re-heats well for the kids, without seeming too dry.
