<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/extra-breast-pumps-and-parts">I had a very rough start to my breastfeeding journey</a>, on my mission to get my breastmilk to come in and catch up to the needs of my newborn I was desperate to try anything. As a mom on a budget I started to create my own cookie that not only tasted great but gave my body the boost it needed to create "liquid gold" (aka milk). Hope these help your journey, too!

They are perfect to satisfy a chocolate craving or the midnight boost you need as a sleep deprived mom.  If you would like them a bit sweeter try upping the maple syrup to ½ cup.  Happy feeding ladies!!

- 2 tablespoons ground flax seed
- 3 tablespoons water
- ½ cup coconut oil (melted or softened)
- ¼ cup maple syrup (room temperature)
- 2 eggs (room temperature)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1½ cups all purpose flour
- ¼ cup cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 2 teaspoons cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 3 cups oats
- 1 cup chocolate chips
- 2 tablespoons brewers yeast (optional)


### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. Line cookie sheet with parchment paper.
3. In a small bowl, combine ground flax seed and water. Set aside.
4. In a medium bowl, sift 1½ cups all purpose flour, ¼ cup cocoa powder, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, ½ teaspoon salt. Mix all together. Add brewers yeast to dry mixture, if desired.
5. In a large bowl, combine ½ cup coconut oil, ¼ cup maple syrup, 2 eggs, and 1 teaspoon vanilla.
6. Add dry mix to wet mixture. Once combined, fold flax seed and water into dough.
7. Stir in oats and chocolate chips, as desired.
8. Scoop dough onto your prepared pan. Cookies are on the dense side so they will not spread.
9. Bake in oven for 10-12 minutes.
10. Remove from oven, let cool and enjoy!!


### Recipe notes:
- They can be stored in fridge for 5 days or freeze for up to 3 months. I love to keep them in the freezer and pull them out a few at a time throughout the day. They will thaw quickly on the counter.
