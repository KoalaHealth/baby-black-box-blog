Another healthy, authentic family recipe from our home to yours!

It would be an understatement to say my husband is not a fan of zucchini, but as the wise say, you can't always get what you want. But, I *tried* and came up with this cheesey, garlic zucchini tot recipe that is hands down our family's favorite zucchini recipe.

**Zucchinis are easy to grow and the littles benefit from a healthy dose of antioxidants and vitamins like folate, vitamin A, and vitamin C.**

This baked zucchini recipe can be on the table in 30 minutes (about 10 mins prep + 20 mins cook) as I finish off a protein on the stove. Enjoy with your family!

### Ingredients (Makes 4 Pizzas)

- 1 medium zucchini
- 1/2 cup panko or bread crumbs
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp onion powder


### Directions

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 1</h5>
Start preheating oven to 400°F.  Prepare a baking pan with silicone baking sheets or parchment paper.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 2</h5>
Grate the zucchini. A standard box grater in the smallest size works well.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 3</h5>
Line a medium bowl with clean kitchen towel or cheese cloth, add grated zucchini, and squeeze out as much liquid as you can.  You can dispose of the liquid.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 4</h5>
In a medium bowl, combine 1 cup grated dried zucchini and the dry ingredients (1/2 cup panko/bread crumbs, 1/4 cup flour, 1/4 shredded cheddar cheese, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp onion powder).  You can use a spatula to mix everything together, but clean hands are recommended though a bit messy.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 5</h5>
Using a tablespoon, portion out rounds of the zucchini mixture and shape into tot shapes.  Place on prepared baking sheet.  Repeat until sheet is full.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 6</h5>
Bake 16-18 minutes or until edges are golden brow and firm to the touch.  If cooking in an air fryer, line with parchment and bake at 400°F for 10 minutes.


I like cooking the tots until there is a crunch on the outside!  I recommend dipping in your favorite sauce, too.  Enjoy this authentic recipe!
