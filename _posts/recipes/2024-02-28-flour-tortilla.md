My family LOVES tortillas. Because one of our New Year's resolutions is to cut back on pre-made/pre-packaged foods, I went on a hunt to create a fool-proof flour tortilla recipe. This recipe is perfect for burritos, wraps, taco nights, and so much more. 

With this step-by-step recipe, you will get 12- 10" tortillas. 


### Ingredient

- 4 cups AP flour or whole wheat 
- ½ tsp salt
- ½ cup butter 
- 1 + 1/3 cup warm water


### Directions

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 1</h5>
Slice butter into cubes and place butter into 1 cup of warm water. Set aside to allow water to melt some of the butter. 

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 2</h5>
In a large bowl, add flour & salt. Lightly mix then pour your butter water into your flour mixture. Mix until water is mostly incorporated. Slowly add additional 1/3 cup of warm water to mixture as you knead until all incorporated and smooth (about 10 minutes by hand) .

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 3</h5>
Cover dough with tea towel & let rest for 10 minutes. 

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 4</h5>
Split dough into 12 equal potions, roll into balls and cover. 

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 5</h5>
Roll each dough ball out to a thin 10" circle in diameter.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 6</h5>
Get a cast iron or non-stick 10.5"+ pan hot. 

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 7</h5>
Place one tortilla on it when the side has bubbled up, flip, and bake until the other side has browned and bubbled. Place in a towel and cover to keep warm, and repeat until finished.

**Serve hot and enjoy!  You can generally store these for a few days in an airtight ziplock at room temperature.**
