This versatile garden fresh dip is my simple, go-to recipe for the family! I serve it warm in the winters or cool in the summers. I love this recipe because it is super forgiving. You can play around and change it to your family preferences or whatever is in your garden or fridge.  We are an olive loving, spice adoring, and tomato picking family who loves to top things with cilantro and green onion.

- 2 tsp onion powder 
- 1 tsp garlic powder

1/2 cup (or more, if desired) shredded cheese (*Mexican* blend or cheddar)

**Optional Toppings/Layers:**

- 1 can sliced black olives 


### Directions

1. In a microwave-safe container (preferably 5x5 or 7x8), evely spread and layer 2 cans or 30 oz refried beans at the bottom of the container. 
2. In a medium bowl, mix 8oz room temperature cream cheese, 2 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp cumin, and 1/2 tsp paprika 
3. Spread cream cheese mixture over refried beans. Smooth the top to create an even layer.
4. Sprinkle grated cheese over cream cheese mixture. 
5. Sprinkle your desired toppings on top of the cheese. This is where you can get creative and make the dip perfect for your family!
6. Warm in microwave for 2 minutes or until cheese is melted and edges are bubbling. 


I love this dish served warm, but it also works well as a cold chip dip. Whether is it served as the main dish, or a supporter at a BBQ, it is a great authentic home recipe!
