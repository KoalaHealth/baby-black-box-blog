### Ingredients

#### Mama's Hot Chocolate
- 8-12 oz of milk of choice
- 1 tbsp cocoa powder
- 2 tbsps maple syrup
- splash of vanilla
- 5 chocolate chips (optional)

#### Maple Whipped Cream
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream
- 2 tbsp maple syrup


### Directions

#### Mama's Hot Chocolate

1. Add cocoa powder, maple syrup, vanilla and chocolate chips to your cup.
2. Fill cup with milk and warm in microwave until desired temp. Once milk is warm slowly stir until well combined (recommend not to over heat in microwave so milk curdles).

#### Maple Whipped Cream

1. Add both heavy whipping cream and maple syrup to a stand mixer. Whisk on high until stiff peaks form.  This will make enough to top about 8 cups of hot chocolate or coffee.
