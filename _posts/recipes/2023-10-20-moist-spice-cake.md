### Ingredients
- 2 1/2 cups all purpose flour 
- 2 teaspoons baking powder 
- 1 teaspoon baking soda 
- 1/2 teaspoon salt 
- 1 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger 
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves 
- 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice 
- 1/2 cups pure maple syrup (or 1 3/4 cups packed dark brown sugar)
- 1 cup unsweetened apple sauce 
- 4 large eggs 
- 2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 
- 1 cup shredded apple (or carrot/ zucchini) 
- Optional: 1 tablespoon molasses


### Optional Cream Cheese Frosting
- 8 oz full-fat, room temperature "brick" of cream cheese
- 1/2 cup room temperature bar of unsalted butter
- 3 cups confectionerss sugar - plus an additional 1/4 cup, if needed 
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 
- 1/8 teaspoon salt


### Directions

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 1</h5>
Preheat oven to 350°F.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 2</h5>
Line a 9 x 13-inch pan (I like glass) or line cupcake tin.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 3</h5>
Whisk together 2 1/2 cups all purpose flour, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1 teaspoon ground ginger, 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves, and 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 4</h5>
In a separate bowl, whisk 1/2 cup pure maple syrup (or 1 3/4 cups packed dark brown sugar), 1 cup unsweetened apple sauce, 4 large eggs, 2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract and 1 tablespoon molasses (if desired).

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 5</h5>
Pour dry ingredients into wet ingredients and whisk until well combined.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 6</h5>
Gently fold in 1 cup shredded apple (or carrot/zucchini) until well combined. 

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 7</h5>
Spread batter into prepared pan, bake 45-50 minutes (12-15 minutes for cupcakes). The cake will be done when a toothpick poked in the center comes out clean. if the cake starts to brown too quickly, loosely cover cake with aluminum foil. 

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 8</h5>
Remove cake/cupcakes from oven and set on wire rack. Allow to cool for about 45 minutes, you can place in refrigerator to speed up the process. 

<h5 class="mb-1">Optional Frosting Step</h5>
If desired, make frosting while cake is cooling and spread frosting over cooled cake. <a href="#frostingRecipeAnchor">Go to recipe below.</a> Refrigerate iced cake before serving to help set frosting for an easier cutting process.  

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 9</h5>
Cover leftover cake and store in refrigerator up to 5 days. 



<h3 id="frostingRecipeAnchor">Directions for Cream Cheese Frosting</h3>

1. In a large bowl, use a hand held or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment and beat the cream cheese and butter together on high speed until smooth and creamy.
2. Add 3 cups confectioners' sugar, vanilla, and salt. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then switch to high speed and beat for another 2 minutes.
3. If you want the frosting a little thicker, add the extra 1/4 cups of confectioners' sugar.
4. Spread the frosting on the cooled cake. refrigerate for 30 minutes before serving. 



I love this cake on its own, but if you are a frosting lover, I recommend pairing it with the homemade cream cheese frosting! Enjoy!
