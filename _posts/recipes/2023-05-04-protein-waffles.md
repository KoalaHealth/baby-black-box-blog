These are nutrition-rich waffles that are friendly for toddlers and perfect for led weaning.


### Ingredients

- 2 cups rolled oats
- 6 eggs
- 2 cups cottage cheese
- Optional: salt and cinnamon to taste


### Directions

1. Put everything in a blender and blend until everything is well combined.
2. Put the batter in a waffle iron and cook until golden brown.


### Recipe notes:
- They are a dense waffle because they're packed with protein and oats. On their own they are a little bland because there is no sugar in them, so that is where the toppings come in (peanut or nut butter, fruit, or even savory with butter and an extra fried egg or bacon).
