### Ingredients
- 1 “Sugar pie” pumpkin


### Directions

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 1</h5>
Preheat oven to 350° Fahrenheit.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 2</h5>
Line baking sheet with parchment paper.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 3</h5>
Cut the stem off your pumpkin then cut your sugar pie pumpkin in half. 

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 4</h5>
Use a sharp spoon or ice cream scooper to scoop out all the seeds and guts. Save seeds to be roasted later. 

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 5</h5>
Place pumpkins inside down on the baking sheet. You want the steam to be trapped in the whole, which will help cook and soften the pumpkin. 

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 6</h5>
Place in oven for 18-20 minutes, until you can easily poke with a fork 

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 7</h5>
Pull out of oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 8</h5>
You can either pull off the skin of the pumpkin with your fingers (my favorite method), or flip the pumpkin halves over and scoop out with a spoon. 

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 9</h5>
Place pumpkin insides in a blender or food processor and blend until smooth. 

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 10</h5>
If your pumpkin is too dry, you can add a little water, but it usually is not needed. 



Enjoy in your favorite pumpkin recipes!!! Store leftover purée in an airtight container for up to 5 days in fridge or place in freezer bags and freeze up to 3 months. 


### Mama's Notes
- Not all pumpkins are good for pies and purees, so make sure it is a pie pumpkin. 
- Canned pumpkin puree has a constant moisture content while home made is going to vary because each pumpkin varies in moisture content. So, if you are making a cake, I would make sure to not add water when puréeing.
