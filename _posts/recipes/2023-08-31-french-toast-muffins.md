As a busy family who loves to go to the park as early as we can, this bite size, on-the-go breakfast is a family favorite - great for the littles and parents. I love how much flavor is packed inside, and they can be stored in the fridge for a quick warm up and carry out-the-door.

### Ingredients

- 2 eggs 
- 2 tablespoons of milk of choice 
- 2 dashes of cinnamon 
- 2 cups of crusts (torn apart into roughly 1 cm pieces) or sliced bread cut into 1 cm pieces  


### Directions

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 1</h5>
Preheat oven to 350Â°F and line cupcake tin (silicone cupcake liners are my favorite).

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 2</h5>
In a small bowl, combine 2 eggs, 2 tablespoons of milk of choice, and 2 dashes of cinnamon. Mix everything until well combined.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 3</h5>
Add two cups of crust-torn into 1 cm pieces (little hands are great at this).

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 4</h5>
Mix everything together until egg mixture fully coats the bread crusts.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 5</h5>
Place a large spoonful of egg and bread mixture into cupcake liners (fill about 3/4th of the way up).

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 6</h5>
Place in oven and bake for 12-15 minutes.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 7</h5>
Let cool a little and enjoy while they're warm!


### Mama's Notes
- If you or your children are maple syrup fans, try adding it to the egg mixture before the bread. This adds the sweetness throughout the delight without having a sticky syrupy mess on a plate.
