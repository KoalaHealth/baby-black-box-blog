This recipe was probably my favorite recipe to test out. My husband LOVES bagels, my daughter LOVES raisins, I LOVE cinnamon and my youngest LOVES anything with cream cheese. So, no matter the modification, the test bagels were eaten. But, I finally came up with the perfect blend of spices for the cinnamon raisin bagel! Hope you enjoy!
