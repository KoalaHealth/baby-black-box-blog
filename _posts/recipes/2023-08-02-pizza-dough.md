excerpt: "Versatile and easy pizza dough base."
---

This pizza dough base is a family favorite with known ingredients.  No weird preservatives or unnecessary chemicals.  Though it's great for pizza, it can be used for garlic knots, cinnamon pull-apart bread, flat bread, and more!

### Ingredients

- 2 1/4 cups (530 mL) warm water
- 1 tbsp (12 g) sugar
- 1 tbsp (9 g) active dry yeast
- 2 tbsps (30 mL) olive oil
- 1 tbsp (18 g) kosher salt
- 5 cups (600 g) bread flour *(bread flour has great, extra protein.  Also, the rise and texture is a bit different with all-purpose, but it can be used.)*
- Additional bread flour for kneading

### Dough Directions

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 1</h5>
Clean and prepare a flat surface for kneading the dough.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 2</h5>
In a large bowl, combine the **2 1/4 cups** (or 530 mL) **warm water**, **1 tbsp** (or 12 g) **sugar**, and **1 tbsp** (or 9 g) **active dry yeast**.  There should be some bubbles after a few minutes (otherwise, fresh yeast may be needed).

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 3</h5>
Add **2 tbsps** (or 30 mL) **olive oil** and **5 cups** (or 600 g) **bread flour** to yeast mixture.  Mix just enough until combined.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 4</h5>
Lightly flour the clean surface and start kneading the dough.  Continue adding flour as needed to keep the dough from being too sticky.  Knead until you can stretch the dough into a thin sheet without tearing.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 5</h5>
(Optional) lightly coat 4 containers with olive oil.  I recommend glass/pyrex containers.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 6</h5>
Divide the dough into 4 equal balls and place into the containers.  Cover the containers with a top or wrap.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 7: Three Options</h5>
You can use the dough the same-day, store in the fridge, or freeze.
- **For same-day use**: allow the dough to rise at room temperature for about two hours.
    - For pizza, I place the oven rack closest to the heating element and bake for about 6-10 minutes at the highest setting (510-550°F or ~265.5-288°C), depending on the toppings.
- **For later use**: place the pizza dough containers in the fridge for 1-7 days for a long, cold rise.
    - For pizza, I recommend allowing the dough to warm at room temp before use, so the dough is workable.
- **For long-term storage**: place the pizza dough in freezer bags or wraps.  Thaw at room temp before use.  You can also pre-roll out/shape the dough with toppings to freeze for fast cook.
