### Ingredients

- 6 pounds pork shoulder or pork butt
- 1 tablespoon onion powder
- 2 tablespoons garlic powder
- 1/2 tablespoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 1/2 to 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (to taste)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt (optional, I personally omit)
- 1/3 cup pickled jalapeños
- 1/3 cup picked jalapeño juice
- 1/3 cup water
- One onion, sliced

### Directions

1. Prep crockpot (I love crockpot liners, linked below)
2. Mix dry ingredients in small bowl (1 tbsp onion powder, 2 tbsp garlic powder, 1/2 tbsp paprika, 1 tsp cumin, 1/2 to 1 tsp cayenne pepper & 1/2 tsp salt, if desired)
3. Cut one onion into slices 
4. Placed half of the onions at the bottom of the crockpot. 
5. Place 6 lbs pork in crockpot, massage half of the dry rub into the pork. Flip pork and continue to rub the rest of the dry rub onto the pork. Make sure to get in every nook and cranny.  
6. Place the rest of the onions and 1/3 cup jalapeños on top and around the pork.  
7. Add jalapeño pickling liquid and water to the crockpot. 
8. Put the lid on make sure that it’s nice and tight. Put it on low for 8 to 14 hours. Mine normally is done around 12 hours. If it is still tough to shred crack, switch to high and let cook for another 1-2 hours
9. Shred in crockpot with fork to enjoy the seasoning and juice.

### Cooks notes: 
- As a busy mama, I have had to come up with recipes my entire family will enjoy but not require me to spend hours in the kitchen. This pulled pork recipe is my family-friendly go-to. The meal that is healthy and safe for everyone from my husband to my 6 month old.
- I love bbq pulled pork and this recipe is the perfect starter.  I separate out some of the juices (leaving pork, onion and jalapeño), add bbq sauce and enjoy!!! It is truly the a tasty blend. 
- Salt is something I try to omit when possible to make meals healtheir. This pulled pork is juicy and delicious even without the salt.
