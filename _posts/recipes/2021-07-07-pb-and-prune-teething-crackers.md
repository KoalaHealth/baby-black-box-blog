excerpt: "A healthy and common allergen-introducing snack for your infant having teething pains."
---

My little one loves the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/prune-puree-teething-crackers">prune purée teething "crackers"</a> I posted about a month ago. So I used them as a base to start introducing allergies.  I found a great way to make sure she consistently has peanut butter in her diet was to make a nut butter and jelly ( prune purée) bar. 

Hope your little one enjoys it! 


### <u>*Warning*: Peanut butter and other ingredients can be allergens. Be ready for any reactions, and if you have any concerns, speak to your healthcare provider first.</u>
