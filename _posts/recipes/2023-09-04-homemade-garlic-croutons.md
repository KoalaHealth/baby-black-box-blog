As a family, we *LOVE* crunch, but I try my best to make sure chips don't enter the house. These were made as a "hmm let's try" recipe, and I got 1 tiny piece as my husband and toddler inhaled the entire tray in an afternoon. SO, I learned quickly to make a big batch and let everyone enjoy. They are perfect as a snack or to top a salad.

### Ingredients

- 3 cups of crusts cubes (torn apart into roughly 1cm-2cm pieces)
- 1/4 cup olive oil 
- 1 tsp onion powder 
- 1 tsp garlic powder 


### Directions

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 1</h5>
Preheat oven to 375Â°F and line large baking sheet. 

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 2</h5>
Tear bread crust into 1-2 cm cube pieces and place in a large bowl. 

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 3</h5>
Drizzle olive oil evenly over bread cubes and toss to ensure they are evenly coated.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 4</h5>
Sprinkle onion and garlic powder over the oil and bread then toss again.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 5</h5>
Spread bread cubes on large baking sheet in an even layer.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 6</h5>
Place tray in oven and bake until golden brown. 

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 7</h5>
Toss half after 8 minutes, so both sides brown. Continue to bake. Time will depend greatly on the size of the cubes so keep a close eye starting at 12 minutes. Mine normally take 15-20 minutes. Enjoy!


### Mama's Notes
- Can be stored in an air tight container on the counter for about a week (they usually only last a day or two in my house).
