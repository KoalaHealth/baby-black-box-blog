### Ingredients

- 2 cups water 
- ¼ cup hot red pepper paste (Gochujang 고추장) 
- 2 cups Tteokbokki rice cakes

*Optional:*
- ¼ Sliced sweet onion 
- 2 tablespoons Sugar (will help cut the spice) 
- 2 Green onions cut into 1 inch chunks 
- 1 cup Fish cakes 


### Directions

1. Add 2 cups of water and ¼ cup hot red pepper paste to a medium saucepan. 
2. Stir until ¼ cup red pepper paste has dissolved. 
3. Add in 2 cups rice cakes and optional items (sweet onion,  fish cakes, green onions) 
4. Let simmer for about 15-20 mins or until rice cakes are tender and liquid starts to thicken. If rice cakes are still tough, add more water to simmer longer. 



As a mixed family, I am first to admit this is not a traditional Tteokbokki, but it is simply delicious for western palates! We love spice, and this is a perfect addition to our family dinners.

### Notes

This dish does not refrigerate and keep well because the rice cake will dry out.
