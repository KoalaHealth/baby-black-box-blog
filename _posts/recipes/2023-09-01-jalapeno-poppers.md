This is not the preservative/chemical-filled, breaded jalapeño found in your local frozen aisle.  Our fresh jalapeño recipe has been a family-favorite for 3 generations, perfected to enhance the natural flavors of the ingredients!  Better ingredients, better taste!

### Mama's Notes
- For bacon lovers: Cook bacon on stove top until crispy. Dice up into vey small pieces and add to cream cheese mixture with the cheese.
- Saving jalapeño seeds: Let seeds dry, then place in an envelope to use next season or plant directly in our garden this season. This is how all 18 of my jalapeño plants were started, and I save seeds every year for future gardens.
