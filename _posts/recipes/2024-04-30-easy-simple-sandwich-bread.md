Prep 20 minutes
Cook time 2 hours (including raise and bake)
**Total time 2 hrs 20 min**

### Ingredient

- 6 cups all purpose flour (the amount of flour will vary based on your area. Drier climates generally use 5 cups of flour)
- 1 tablespoon sugar 
- 1/2 tablespoon salt 
- 1 tablespoon avocado oil (or light tasting oil) 
- 4 teaspoons regular or quick acting yeast 
- 2 1/4 cups warm water (not too warm, it will kill the yeast) 


### Directions

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 1</h5>
Mix 5 cups of flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in a large bowl or mixer.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 2</h5>
Add warm water and oil. Knead with a mixer on low speed for 2 minutes, scape side of bowl down as needed.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 3</h5>
Add remaining 1 cup of flour, knead for an additional 4-5 minutes until dough is smooth and elastic. (if mixing by hand, knead for 5-7 minutes until smooth) 

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 4</h5>
Place dough in a large bowl. Allow to rise for 1 hours (cover with tea towels or lightly with plastic wrap) so that dough can double in size.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 5</h5>
Grease bottoms and sides of 2 loaf pans or 6 mini loaf pans.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 6</h5>
Turn dough onto counter and cut in half for 2 loaves or in 6 equal pieces for mini loaves.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 7</h5>
Gently pat or lightly roll dough into a 6"x9" rectangle.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 8</h5>
Roll up dough lengthwise, tuck ends under, and place in the prepared loaf pans.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 9</h5>
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 10</h5>
Allow loaves to rise an additional 45 minutes. DON'T SKIP THIS STEP (this will ensure that your bread is light and airy).

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 11</h5>
Bake loaves 23-25 minutes.


### Koala Mama Notes:
- Immediately remove bread from pans. This will avoid the bottoms from getting soggy from the condensation. 
- This bread freezes wonderfully, allow bread to FULLY cool (this is a must) then place in freezer bag. When you want to use it pull it out and let it come to room temp. I love slicing it before freezing it so I can pull out a few slices at a time and toast them up. 


**Enjoy!**
