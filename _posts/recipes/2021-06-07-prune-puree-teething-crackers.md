excerpt: "A healthy and nutritional snack for your infant having teething pains."
---

As I started my baby-led weaning journey, I realized having quick healthy snacks were a must. I also realized constipation is a common part of babies' introduction to new foods. So, I worked to create a kid friendly-teething cracker that can be stored in the fridge or freezer. These crackers can be stored easily and tossed in the diaper bag for a fun outing or a snack around the house.
