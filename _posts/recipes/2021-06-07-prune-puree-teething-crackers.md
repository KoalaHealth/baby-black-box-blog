excerpt: "A healthy and nutritional snack for your infant having teething pains."
---

As I started my baby-led weaning journey, I realized having quick healthy snacks were a must. I also realized constipation is a common part of babies' introduction to new foods. So, I worked to create a kid friendly-teething cracker that can be stored in the fridge or freezer. These crackers can be stored easily and tossed in the diaper bag for a fun outing or a snack around the house.

    * **Option 1**: 1 heaping cup of flour into a blender until oats take on a flour like texture. 
    * **Option 2**: 1/2 a cup of oat flour for 1/2 cup of baby oatmeal will up the iron levels and help you use up the baby oatmeal you have leftover
