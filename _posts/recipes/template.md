### Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups warm milk
- 1/3 cup melted butter
- 2 eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 cups all-purpose flour

### Directions

#### Step 1
Either leave 1 1/2 cups of milk at room temperature or warm milk for about 30 seconds.  Pour into large metal bowl.

#### Step 2
Melt 1/3 cup of butter in microwave and add to milk.

#### Step 3
Add 2 eggs, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon salt, 4 teaspoons baking powder, and 2 tablespoons white sugar and mix.

#### Step 4
Slowly add and mix 2 cups of all-purpose flour as you mix.

#### Personal Preference
We like to cook the waffles on setting 2, which cooks the waffles before it becomes crunchy.  Re-heats well for the kids, without seeming too dry.
