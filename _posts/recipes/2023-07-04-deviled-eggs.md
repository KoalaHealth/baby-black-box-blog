Deviled eggs for pickle lovers.  Must love pickles!

### Ingredients

- 8 hard boiled eggs 
- ½ tsp mustard 
- ¼ cup finely diced pickles

### Directions

1. Cut hard boiled eggs in half, lengthwise (the long way).
2. Separate the egg yolks from the whites into two different bowls.
3. Finely dice pickles (1/4 cup).
4. Using a fork, mash egg yolks, while adding finely diced pickles to yolks. Stir until combined.
5. Add mustard and 4 tsp of pickle juice to yolk and pickle mixture. Stir until well combined, use more pickle juice to thin the mixture, if you want it thinner.
