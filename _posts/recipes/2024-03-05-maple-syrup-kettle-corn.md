excerpt: "Who doesn't love homemade kettle corn?  But, have you tried maple syrup kettle corn?"
---

I have loved kettle corn for as long as I can remember. As a kid, my mom had the "old-school popper" that you hand cranked over the stove. I remember when I would put too many kernels in the sides would pop open, shooting hot kettle corn across the kitchen. But, you don't need a vintage kettle corn maker, and they taste great!

### Ingredient

- 1/4 cup heat-safe oil (coconut oil, if you want to make it vegan)
- 1/3 cup popcorn kernels
- 3 tablespoons maple syrup
- Pinch of salt


### Directions

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 1</h5>
Melt oil over medium-high in a heavy-bottomed saucepan with a lid. Add three kernels of popcorn and place lid on pan.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 2</h5>
Once all 3 kernels have popped, remove from heat and take out 3 popped kernels.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 3</h5>
Dump in the remaining popcorn kernels, replace lid, and shake the saucepan for 30 seconds off the heat to coat the kernels with cooking oil.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 4</h5>
Place pan back on heat and shake to prevent burning.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 5</h5>
Once the kernels begin popping actively, remove from heat again and stir in maple syrup and salt.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 6</h5>
Return to heat. Shake frequently to prevent burning!

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 7</h5>
Popping is complete when there are 3-5 seconds between pops.

<h5 class="mb-1">Step 8</h5>
Dump kettle corn onto parchment paper and let cool slightly.


**Enjoy!**
