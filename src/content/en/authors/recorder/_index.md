## Introduction

The flight recorder of the Baby Black Box is a first-time father trying to get it right in one shot.  All content was noted in the moments immediately following the thought or experience and written up quickly thereafter.  The idea was the information would have a greater chance of remaining true to the experience, if there is less cleansing and beautification of the retelling with retrospection.
