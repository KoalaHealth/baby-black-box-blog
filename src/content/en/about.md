Buckle up your seatbelts, boys and girls, unsightly content ahead (written with a healthy handful of words nobody understands, for your pleasure)!  In my defense, parenting is often dirty and ugly - at least the way I do it.

<br />

The idea to record my "fresh father" learnings came from my friends, who requested I write up a google doc of things I have learned in my new journey.  Being one of the first in the group to take this life changing step (to go "full sea horse," the best of nature's fathers), I indubitably obliged.  However, being neither pleb, nor peasant, I wrote this "bad boy blog" instead.

P.S. I hope my wife does not read this.  She disapproves of me broadcasting irreverent and bawdy humor to the world (only the best for my friends).  I love you dear.
