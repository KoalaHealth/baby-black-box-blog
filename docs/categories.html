    "body": "Baby Black Box safeguards parents’ &amp; guardians’ insights on life’s amazingly common but surprisingly unique experiences. : The idea to record my “fresh father learnings” came from my friends.  They asked me to write up a shared doc of things I have learned in my new journey.  Being one of the first in the group to take this life changing step (of going “full sea horse,” the best of nature’s fathers), I reluctantly obliged.  However, being neither pleb, nor peasant, I wrote this “share-all blog” instead - public and open to everyone.  Anonymity protects and let’s me be honest. This is my experience, and I hope you find it helpful, amusing, and supportive.  Yours will probably be different. If you are a parent and want to share, apply to be a parent writer! We make it easy.  You don’t have to be good at writing, because our parent team will keep your thoughts “seecret” and edit the post for you.  You just need to be an honest parent (we hear sharing can be helpful for parents)! "

Pour into large metal bowl. Step 2: Melt 1/3 cup of butter in microwave and add to milk. Step 3: Add 2 eggs, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon salt, 4 teaspoons baking powder, and 2 tablespoons white sugar and mix. Step 4: Slowly add and mix 2 cups of all-purpose flour as you mix. Personal Preference: We like to cook the waffles on setting 2, which cooks the waffles before it becomes crunchy.  Re-heats well for the kids, without seeming too dry. "

    "body": "2021/09/30 - How I prepared my oldest for the arrival of our new baby. I found the key to our success was start as early as possible. I started some of these steps as it became age appropriate, knowing we wanted two under two. 1) Encouraging independent play2) Teaching words and context3) Promoting helpful behavior4) Refreshing toys to keep her playing5) Link “giving behavior” with new sibling6) Newborn prep7) Consistent 1-on-1 time8) Encourage independence9) Read together 1st: I made a very strong effort to encourage independent play multiple times a day, everyday. Especially days and times my husband and I were both home. 2nd: I would ask her “where is mama’s baby?” so she could at least hear the word “baby” in reference to something other than her. I stopped referring to her as a baby and would correct others in front of her. I would say big girl or toddler. So she would differentiate that she is bigger than the baby. 3rd: I would get her involved in diaper changing, because she would already tell me when she was dirty. So, now I would say, “can you bring me the diaper, wipes etc. ?”4th: I removed all the baby toys and packed them away. I did not bring them back out until the baby was a few weeks old. 5th: I had a small “quiet” toy that the baby could give Mary when they met. 6th: I brought out the baby clothes and other newborn items from the closet early, making room for the baby in our life when I was 7-8 months along. This gave our oldest time to adjust to all the new things before the baby arrived. This includes moving the care seat over if the oldest is still in the middle of the car. 7th: Have time for special 1 on 1 time with the oldest with each parent. I focused on things we could continue after the new baby arrives. 8th: Encourage independence in whatever way you can. Whether it’s asking the oldest to put on their own shoes, get their own jacket, pick out their own clothes, or get their water, it saves you a little bit of time and energy. To make it easier, put their bottles/cups on the counter and whatever other pre-prep you need. 9th: reading reading reading. We love reading and this is something you can do postpartum. It is also something that can help calm the child down. We can create a game out of finding specific books. We also use going to the library as a day trip. That gets the kids out and can keep the readings fresh. "

I read tons of mom blogs and watched hundreds of hours of vlogs. To me, it all boiled down to everyone’s budget, space, ideas and values are different. You will want to spend money on some things and you will be open to accepting certain things second hand. This was our journey: We joined the Facebook Buy Nothing group and Nextdoor for our local area. These sites gave us access to free/ cheap second hand items. As my husband and I were both working very demanding full time jobs and we knew we had a tight budget, we made a list of everything we needed/ wanted. This allowed both of us to look and respond to posts without having to text or call the other. What we sourced:  Clothes 0-3 and 3-6 months Pack and play Bouncers Walker Swings (two different kids) Breast pumps and partsMy husband is way more tech savvy and loves to search through sites. So we were able to successfully source the entire list above as well as:  a changing table with silicone change pad diaper bag new elephant basket with new baby toys baby blanketsIt takes time so start early! These site will continue to help you parent on a budget as your child/ children grow. "

    "title": "Traditional Crib vs Pack and Play",
    "body": "2020/05/22 - Let me tell you why my family chose a pack and play instead of a traditional crib and bassinet. After tons of reading, researching, and reading some more, our reasons can be boiled down to: money, functionality, and space. First, let’s start with money. Pack and plays are significantly cheaper. The below breakdown shows on average you will save $200 by using a pack and play instead of a traditional crib. A traditional crib/ bassinet:  Crib - $200 Mattress- $90 Crib sheets -$10 Bassinet- $100 Bassinet sheets- $20 Total: $320Pack and play with a bassinet attachment:  Pack and play- $80 Mattress -$30 Sheets - $10Total: $120Second, I looked at functionality. A bassinet can only be used until your child rolls over (3-6 month milestone) or reaches a specific weight, typically 15+ pounds. The American Association of Pediatrics recommends sharing a room with your child until they reach 6 months. So, you will likely need to transition your child from the bassinet to the crib before the six month mark. This means you will need to make room for a crib in your room or make room for a bed in your child’s nursery.  A pack and play is designed to be folded up and moved with ease. So, you can move it once your child is 6 months, and it will only take a few minutes with no tools other than your hands. Finally, having extra space is always a plus. My family lives in a one bedroom apartment. So, having one item for all sleep stages is perfect for us. We also plan to have additional kids so we won’t need to store bulky baby items between each child. Important notes:We were able to source a pack and play with a bassinet attachment from Nextdoor for free.  This is when we discovered we didn’t need a crib! But, if we purchased one, we would have bought the full size pack and play with bassinet attachments $80 on Amazon Quick and easy purchase guide: Pack and play mattress sheets "
