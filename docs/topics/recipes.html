    "body": "Baby Black Box safeguards parents’ &amp; guardians’ insights on life’s amazingly common but surprisingly unique experiences. : Why Black Box?Black boxes are emergency information storage devices on planes that live record audio in the cockpit and important information in the flight - just in case.  These online “live” posts are baby black boxes of real parents on their journey, shared just in case it’s helpful. The idea to record my “fresh father learnings” came from my friends.  They asked me to write up a shared doc of things I have learned in my new journey.  Being one of the first in the group to take this life changing step (of going “full sea horse,” the best of nature’s fathers), I reluctantly obliged.  However, being neither pleb, nor peasant, I wrote this “share-all blog” instead - public and open to everyone.  Anonymity protects and let’s me be honest. This is my experience, and I hope you find it helpful, amusing, and supportive.  Yours will probably be different. If you are a parent and want to share, apply to be a parent writer! We make it easy.  You don’t have to be good at writing, because our parent team will keep your thoughts “seecret” and edit the post for you.  You just need to be an honest parent (we hear sharing can be helpful for parents)! "

    "body": "2023/04/29 - Spring has sprung and family bbq’s and gatherings are around the corner! In this season of family and stork deliveries, the “baby pass around” can get out-of-hand. As a mama who’s not keen on everyone holding her baby, I wanted to share my story with you, because it’s okay not to have your kids passed around like a platter of watermelon. I was lucky enough to have both of my children during Covid. Yup, lucky. If the pandemic had not shaken up how we gather with friends and family, I would have never been comfortable creating strong boundaries around who holds my kids, especially my newborns. As a first time mom, I felt pressured and pushed by some family to automatically give permission to hold my daughter. I wanted to be a good daughter-in-law, so I caved. But, this was a mistake. Just in case, my secret identity is revealed, I won’t call out anyone directly, but some people just don’t know how to safely hold children. I drew the line when a former parent tried to lift my newborn straightup by her arms. I immediately stepped in, but not before my daughter let out a heart-stopping screech. She was fine. I was not. The trust had been broken. After a successful second delivery, I put my “big girl pants on” and was ready for the inevitable “baby showing. ” This time the “sure, you can hold him”s were replaced by the “I’m not ready”s. Because, honestly, I was not ready. I wanted more time to bond with my son. I was too tired and already in a battle zone, trying to survive (again). But most importantly, I did not have the extra energy to spend playing “whack-a-mole,” figuring out which of my family and friends, who I love dearly, did not know how to safely hold a kid but still asked. I can tell you I was truly at peace with my second, and he has had no problem being held as an infant. My first on the other hand still does not like to sit on people’s laps or hug people. And yes, I do think part of this difference is because she knew I wasn’t at peace with handing her over. So, Mamas and Papas, you do you! Don’t feel pressured to go beyond what your gut says is best for your child. A very important factor to successfully maintaining your boundaries is the support you have with your partner. I was a bit extra but my husband never pressured me and 100% supported my feelings. Which was honestly a pivotal point in our transition to parenthood and two going to four. If you want to hear my excuses to avoid handing off my kid:Things I did to avoid people asking. "

    "body": "2023/04/29 -    Baby wear!!! This means slings, pouches, backpacks… Honestly it’s amazing!!! And the more kids you have, the more acceptable it is.     The sit with us. Put a blanket down and sit with the baby on the floor so they can play. When someone approaches with that “I-want-to-hold-your-baby look,” just say “oh hey, sit with us. ” It’s very effective. It’s about riding the wave, not fighting it.     The poop change. Thanks to the poop machines, I can use the “oh let me change him/her,” then circle to another group afterward. I also don’t let anyone change my kids either other than my husband and me. Sensing a pattern? Like I said, you do you. Listen to your good judgment.     The “we tried. ” If my kid cries when someone is holding them I 100% take my kid back, especially if they say “no, it’s ok - babies need to cry. ” The next time they ask to hold them I just say “no, it’s okay. ”     The practice makes perfect (don’t hold my kid). Once they start walking, my go-to is “they need to practice, you can walk with them and make sure they don’t fall. ” This is especially effective with those older kids that want to start picking them up.

    "body": "2021/09/30 - How I prepared my oldest for the arrival of our new baby. I found the key to our success was to start as early as possible. I started some of these steps as it became age appropriate, knowing we wanted two under two.  Encouraging independent play Teaching words and context Promoting helpful behavior Refreshing toys to keep her playing Link “giving behavior” with new sibling Newborn prep Consistent 1-on-1 time Encourage independence Read together1: I made a very strong effort to encourage independent play multiple times a day, everyday. Especially days and times my husband and I were both home. 2: I would ask her “where is mama’s baby?” so she could at least hear the word “baby” in reference to something other than her. I stopped referring to her as a baby and would correct others in front of her. I would say big girl or toddler. So she would differentiate that she is bigger than the baby. 3: I would get her involved in diaper changing, because she would already tell me when she was dirty. So, now I would say, “can you bring me the diaper, wipes etc. ?” 4: I removed all the baby toys and packed them away. I did not bring them back out until the baby was a few weeks old. 5: I had a small “quiet” toy that the baby could give Mary when they met. 6: I brought out the baby clothes and other newborn items from the closet early, making room for the baby in our life when I was 7-8 months along. This gave our oldest time to adjust to all the new things before the baby arrived. This includes moving the care seat over if the oldest is still in the middle of the car. 7: Have time for special 1 on 1 time with the oldest with each parent. I focused on things we could continue after the new baby arrives. 8: Encourage independence in whatever way you can. Whether it’s asking the oldest to put on their own shoes, get their own jacket, pick out their own clothes, or get their water, it saves you a little bit of time and energy. To make it easier, put their bottles/cups on the counter and whatever other pre-prep you need. 9: reading reading reading. We love reading and this is something you can do postpartum. It is also something that can help calm the child down. We can create a game out of finding specific books. We also use going to the library as a day trip. That gets the kids out and can keep the readings fresh. "

To me, it all boiled down to everyone’s different budget, space, ideas and values. You will want to spend money on some things and be open to accepting certain things secondhand. This was our journey: We joined the local Facebook Buy Nothing group and Nextdoor for our local area. These sites gave us access to free/cheap secondhand items. As my husband and I were both working very demanding full time jobs and we knew we had a tight budget, we made a list of everything we needed/ wanted. This allowed both of us to look and respond to posts without having to text or call the other. What we sourced:  Clothes 0-3 and 3-6 months Pack and play Bouncers Walker Swings (two different kids) Breast pumps and partsMy husband is wayyy more tech savvy and loves to search through sites. So we were able to successfully source the entire list above as well as:  a changing table with silicone change pad diaper bag new elephant basket with new baby toys baby blanketsIt takes time so start early! I’ll share more posts to help you parent on a budget as your children grow! "

    "title": "Traditional Crib vs Pack and Play",
    "body": "2020/05/22 - Let me tell you why my family chose a pack and play instead of a traditional crib and bassinet. After tons of reading, researching, and reading some more, our reasons boiled down to: money, functionality, and space. First, let’s start with money. Pack and plays are significantly cheaper. The below breakdown shows on average you will save $200 by using a pack and play instead of a traditional crib. A traditional crib/ bassinet:  Crib - $200 Mattress- $90 Crib sheets -$10 Bassinet- $100 Bassinet sheets- $20Total: $320 Pack and play with a bassinet attachment:  Pack and play- $80 Mattress -$30 Sheets - $10Total: $120 Any purchases you make through our links supports our parents! Second, I looked at functionality. A bassinet can only be used until your child rolls over (3-6 month milestone) or reaches a specific weight, typically 15+ pounds. The American Association of Pediatrics recommends sharing a room with your child until they reach 6 months. So, you will likely need to transition your child from the bassinet to the crib before the six month mark. This means you will need to make room for a crib in your room or make room for a bed in your child’s nursery.  A pack and play is designed to be folded up and moved with ease. So, you can move it once your child is 6 months, and it will only take a few minutes with no tools other than your hands. Finally, having extra space is always a plus. My family lives in a one bedroom apartment. So, having one item for all sleep stages is perfect for us. We also plan to have additional kids so we won’t need to store bulky baby items between each child. Important notes: We were able to source a pack and play with a bassinet attachment from Nextdoor for free.  This is when we discovered we didn’t need a crib! But, if we purchased one, we would have bought the full size pack and play with bassinet attachments $80 on Amazon Quick and easy purchase guide:  Pack and play mattress sheetsAny purchases you make through our links supports our parents!

Whether you have a spouse, fellow guardian, or are flying solo, I try to get as much done and ready for the little ones whenever I have the energy.  Most days I’m going all out and pushing until my energy is empty, but over time, like a muscle, I’ve found I can push through more and more. Like my policy on good dating, I work to think ahead, consider what the other would want, and enjoy the good and bad moments.  I figure with my kids, they’re only going to want to hug me until they make their first friend in preschool. Fasten your seatbelts and enjoy the ride! "
