In this season of family and stork deliveries, the “baby pass around” can get out-of-hand. As a mama who’s not keen on everyone holding her baby, I wanted to share my story with you, because it’s okay not to have your kids passed around like a platter of watermelon.</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to have both of my children during Covid. Yup, lucky. If the pandemic had not shaken up how we gather with friends and family, I would have never been comfortable creating strong boundaries around who holds my kids, especially my newborns.</p>

<p>As a first time mom, I felt pressured and pushed by some family to automatically give permission to hold my daughter. I wanted to be a good daughter-in-law, so I caved. But, this was a mistake.</p>

<p>Just in case, my secret identity is revealed, I won’t call out anyone directly, but some people just don’t know how to safely hold children. I drew the line when a former parent tried to lift my newborn straightup by her arms. I immediately stepped in, but not before my daughter let out a heart-stopping screech. She was fine. I was not. The trust had been broken.</p>

<p>After a successful second delivery, I put my “big girl pants on” and was ready for the inevitable “baby showing.” This time the “sure, you can hold him”s were replaced by the “I’m not ready”s. Because, honestly, I was not ready. I wanted more time to bond with my son. I was too tired and already in a battle zone, trying to survive (again). But most importantly, I did not have the extra energy to spend playing “whack-a-mole,” figuring out which of my family and friends, who I love dearly, did not know how to safely hold a kid but still asked.</p>

<p>I can tell you I was truly at peace with my second, and he has had no problem being held as an infant. My first on the other hand still does not like to sit on people’s laps or hug people. And yes, I do think part of this difference is because she knew I wasn’t at peace with handing her over. So, Mamas and Papas, you do you! Don’t feel pressured to go beyond what your gut says is best for your child.</p>

<p>A very important factor to successfully maintaining your boundaries is the support you have with your partner. I was a bit <em>extra</em> but my husband never pressured me and 100% supported my feelings. Which was honestly a pivotal point in our transition to parenthood and two going to four.</p>

<p>If you want to hear my excuses to avoid handing off my kid:

  <li>
    <p><strong>Baby wear!!!</strong> This means slings, pouches, backpacks… Honestly it’s amazing!!! And the more kids you have, the more acceptable it is.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The sit with us.</strong> Put a blanket down and sit with the baby on the floor so they can play. When someone approaches with that “I-want-to-hold-your-baby look,” just say “oh hey, sit with us.” It’s very effective. It’s about riding the wave, not fighting it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The poop change.</strong> Thanks to the poop machines, I can use the “oh let me change him/her,” then circle to another group afterward. I also don’t let anyone change my kids either other than my husband and me. Sensing a pattern? Like I said, you do you. Listen to your good judgment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The “we tried.”</strong> If my kid cries when someone is holding them I <em>100%</em> take my kid back, especially if they say “no, it’s ok - babies need to cry.” The next time they ask to hold them I just say “no, it’s okay.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The practice makes perfect (don’t hold my kid).</strong> Once they start walking, my go-to is  “they need to practice, you can walk with them and make sure they don’t fall.” This is especially effective with those older kids that want to start picking them up.</p>

<p>Take a peak inside an Easter basket without refined sugars. My goal in putting together my kids’ baskets is to get them set up for spring/summer activities.
Some of the items I include or look for are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sun hats</li>
  <li>Sun glasses</li>
  <li>Sandals</li>
  <li>Bubbles</li>
  <li>Sand toys</li>
  <li>Water toys</li>
  <li>Kites</li>
  <li>Gardening supplies</li>
  <li>Markers &amp; notebook</li>
  <li>Kid safe scissors (age 2+)</li>
  <li>Paint &amp; brushes</li>
  <li>Toothbrushes</li>
</ul>

<p>What I put in the Easter eggs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pom poms</li>
  <li>Colored pingpong balls</li>
  <li>Hair clips and bows</li>
</ul>

<p>This year I focused on things I could use for sensory/cognitive play. Plus bows, because they were just too cute to pass up.</p>

<p>One of the main benefits to creating baskets focused on things my little ones need (can play with) is that it keeps them busy for months and avoids sugar highs and crashes. I also use baskets that can be reused through the year. Those cute Easter baskets are so so tempting but you store it for 364 days for one day of photos.</p>

<p>Quick tip: If you choose to put chocolate and treats in your little ones basket, remember to avoid small hard candies, that can be a choking hazard. Consider making them some <a href="/pb-and-prune-teething-crackers">PB+Prune Teething Crackers</a></p>

I found the key to our success was to <em>start as early as possible</em>. I started some of these steps as it became age appropriate, knowing we wanted two under two.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Encouraging independent play</li>
  <li>Teaching words and context</li>
  <li>Promoting helpful behavior</li>
  <li>Refreshing toys to keep her playing</li>
  <li>Link “giving behavior” with new sibling</li>
  <li>Newborn prep</li>
  <li>Consistent 1-on-1 time</li>
  <li>Encourage independence</li>
  <li>Read together</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>1</strong>: I made a very strong effort to encourage independent play multiple times a day, everyday. Especially days and times my husband and I were both home.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong>: I would ask her “where is mama’s baby?” so she could at least hear the word “baby” in reference to something other than her. 
I stopped referring to her as a baby and would correct others in front of her. I would say big girl or toddler. So she would differentiate that she is bigger than the baby.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong>: I would get her involved in diaper changing, because she would already tell me when she was dirty. So, now I would say, “can you bring me the diaper, wipes etc.?”</p>

<p><strong>4</strong>: I removed all the baby toys and packed them away. I did not bring them back out until the baby was a few weeks old.</p>

<p><strong>5</strong>: I had a small “quiet” toy that the baby could give Mary when they met.</p>

<p><strong>6</strong>: I brought out the baby clothes and other newborn items from the closet early, making room for the baby in our life when I was 7-8 months along. This gave our oldest time to adjust to all the new things before the baby arrived. This includes moving the care seat over if the oldest is still in the middle of the car.</p>

<p><strong>7</strong>: Have time for special 1 on 1 time with the oldest with each parent. I focused on things we  could continue after the new baby arrives.</p>

<p><strong>8</strong>: Encourage independence in whatever way you can. Whether it’s asking the oldest to put on their own shoes, get their own jacket, pick out their own clothes, or get their water, it saves you a little bit of time and energy. To make it easier, put their bottles/cups on the counter and whatever other pre-prep you need.</p>

<p><strong>9</strong>: reading reading reading. We love reading and this is something you can do postpartum. It is also something that can help calm the child down. We can create a game out of finding specific books. We also use going to the library as a day trip. That gets the kids out and can keep the readings fresh.</p>]]></content><author><name>koalamama</name></author><category term="parent" /><category term="featured" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How two is different than one.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.babyblackbox.com/assets/images/7.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.babyblackbox.com/assets/images/7.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Peanut Butter and Prune Teething Crackers</title><link href="https://www.babyblackbox.com/pb-and-prune-teething-crackers/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Peanut Butter and Prune Teething Crackers" /><published>2021-07-07T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-07-07T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://www.babyblackbox.com/pb-and-prune-teething-crackers</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.babyblackbox.com/pb-and-prune-teething-crackers/"><![CDATA[<p>My little one loves the <a href="/prune-puree-teething-crackers">prune purée teething “crackers”</a> I posted about a month ago.

I also realized constipation is a common part of babies’ introduction to new foods. So, I worked to create a kid friendly-teething cracker that can be stored in the fridge or freezer. These crackers can be stored easily and tossed in the diaper bag for a fun outing or a snack around the house.</p>

I did not find out until I was filling out the questionnaire for my child’s one month doctors appointment.  Breast fed babies receive almost all of the nutrition that they need through the mother’s breast milk but they do not receive vitamin D, so it is important that you give them a drop a day.</p>

<p>It seems like such a simple, small thing but in the moment, it seemed like another huge thing to remember. Between being sleep deprived, trying to figure out the breastfeeding thing, pumping to get enough milk for my child, trying to create a freezer stash, taking my vitamins, feeding the family, and making sure the drops are given. I found the easiest way to remember was to store all the vitamin’s together and keep them where you sit or on your table where you eat (if you have other children, don’t forget to keep them up high).</p>]]></content><author><name>koalamama</name></author><category term="new parent" /><category term="first time parent" /><category term="parent" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Parenting is hard.
